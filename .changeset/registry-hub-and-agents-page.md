Restructure registry: unified hub page and dedicated agents page

- `/registry` is now a hub page showing all four entity types (Members, Agents, Brands, Properties)
- `/agents` is now the dedicated agent registry page (formerly at `/registry`)
- The duplicate "quick links" section that mirrored the tabs on the agent page has been removed
- `agents`, `brands`, and `publishers` added to reserved member profile slugs
