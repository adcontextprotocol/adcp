Brand registry as primary company identity source. Member profiles now link to the brand registry via `primary_brand_domain` instead of storing logos and colors directly. Members set up their brand through the brand tools and get a hosted brand.json at `agenticadvertising.org/brands/yourdomain.com/brand.json`. Placing a one-line pointer at `/.well-known/brand.json` makes AgenticAdvertising.org the authoritative brand source for any domain.
