fix: simplify engagement scoring and fix working group leader detection

- Simplified engagement scoring: 10 points per Slack action + 20 points per event (capped at 100)
- Fixed working group count to include leaders as implicit members
- Committee leaders no longer receive "Discover Working Groups" recommendations
