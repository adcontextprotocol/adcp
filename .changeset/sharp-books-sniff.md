Simplify changelog approach: Rename changelog to release-notes with high-level summaries.

**Documentation changes only:**
- Renamed `docs/reference/changelog.md` â†’ `docs/reference/release-notes.mdx`
- Release notes now focus on high-level "What's New" summaries with migration guides
- Links to CHANGELOG.md for full technical details
- Updated CLAUDE.md with process for writing release notes after each release
- Updated sidebar navigation and homepage links

This is a documentation-only change with no impact on schemas, APIs, or functionality.
