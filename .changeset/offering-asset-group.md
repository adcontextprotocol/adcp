Note: These changes are breaking relative to earlier betas but no fields removed here were ever in a stable release.

Add `sync_catalogs` task and unified `Catalog` model. Replace separate `offerings[]` and `product_selectors` fields on `PromotedOfferings` with a typed `Catalog` object that supports inline items, external URL references, and platform-synced catalogs. Expand catalog types beyond offerings and product to include inventory, store, and promotion feeds. Add `sync_catalogs` task with request/response schemas, async response patterns (working, input-required, submitted), per-catalog approval workflow, and item-level review status. Add `catalog_requirements` on `Format` so formats can declare what catalog feeds they need and what fields each must provide. Add `OfferingAssetGroup` schema for structured per-offering creative pools, `OfferingAssetConstraint` for format-level asset requirements, and `geo_targets` on `Offering` for location-specific offerings. Add `account-state` conceptual doc framing Account as the central stateful container in AdCP 3.0. Rename promoted-offerings doc to catalogs to reflect its expanded scope. Add `StoreItem` schema for physical locations within store-type catalogs, with lat/lng coordinates, structured address, operating hours, and tags. Add `Catchment` schema for defining store catchment areas via three methods: isochrone inputs (travel time + transport mode), simple radius, or pre-computed GeoJSON geometry. Add `transport-mode` and `distance-unit` enums. Add industry-vertical catalog types (`hotel`, `flight`, `job`, `vehicle`, `real_estate`, `education`, `destination`) with canonical item schemas for each, drawn from Google Ads, Meta, LinkedIn, and Microsoft platform feed specs. Add shared `Price` schema. Add `linkedin_jobs` feed format. Remove `PromotedOfferings` wrapper — catalogs are now first-class. Creatives reference catalogs via `catalog` field instead of embedding in assets. Remove `promoted_offering` from media-buy and creative-manifest schemas. Add `conversion_events` and `content_id_type` to Catalog for conversion attribution. Rename catalog type `offerings` to `offering` for consistency with other singular type names. Remove `portfolio_ref` from Offering — structured `assets` (OfferingAssetGroup) replaces external portfolio references. Replace `product_selectors` (PromotedProducts) on `get_products` with `catalog` ($ref catalog.json) — one concept, one schema. Delete `promoted-products.json`. Add `catalog_types` to Product so products declare what catalog types they support. Add `matched_ids` and `matched_count` to `catalog_match`, remove `matched_skus`. Add `catalog` field to `package-request` and `package-update` for catalog-driven packages. Add `store_catchments` targeting dimension referencing synced store catalogs. Add `by_catalog_item` delivery breakdown in `get_media_buy_delivery` response for per-item reporting on catalog-driven packages. Update `creative-variant` description to clarify that catalog items rendered as ads are variants.
