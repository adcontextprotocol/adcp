Expand bundled schemas to all task categories and document GitHub access

- Updated build-schemas.cjs to bundle all task request/response schemas, not just media-buy and signals. Now bundles: creative, property, content-standards, sponsored-intelligence, protocol, and core tasks (71 schemas total, up from ~25).
- Updated schemas-and-sdks.mdx to document GitHub as a source for bundled schemas, including raw URLs, directory structure, and all bundled schema categories.
