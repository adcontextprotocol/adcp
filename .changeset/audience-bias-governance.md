Add structured audience data for bias/fairness governance validation.

**Schemas**: audience-selector (signal ref or description), audience-constraints (include/exclude), policy-category-definition (regulatory regime groupings), attribute-definition (restricted data categories), match-id-type (identity resolution enum), restricted-attribute (GDPR Article 9 enum).

**Plan fields**: policy_categories, audience constraints (include/exclude), restricted_attributes, restricted_attributes_custom, min_audience_size. Separates brand.industries (what the company is) from plan.policy_categories (what regulatory regimes apply).

**Governance**: audience_targeting on governance-context and planned-delivery for three-way comparison. audience_distribution on delivery_metrics for demographic drift detection. restricted_attributes and policy_categories on signal-definition.json for structural governance matching.

**Registry**: 10 policy category definitions (children_directed, political_advertising, age_restricted, gambling_advertising, fair_housing, fair_lending, fair_employment, pharmaceutical_advertising, health_wellness, firearms_weapons). 8 restricted attribute definitions (GDPR Article 9 categories). 13 seed policies covering US (FHA, ECOA, EEOC, COPPA, FDA DTC, FTC health claims, TTB alcohol, state gambling), EU (DSA political targeting, prescription DTC ban, GDPR special category targeting), and platform (special ad categories, firearms) regulations.

**Media buy**: per-identifier-type match_breakdown and effective_match_rate on sync_audiences response (#1314).

**Docs**: Updated governance specification, sync_plans, check_governance, policy registry, sync_audiences, brand protocol, and signal/data provider documentation.
