Move sync_accounts and list_accounts task reference pages from Media Buy Protocol to Building with AdCP > Foundations. These tasks are shared across all vendor protocols (media buy, signals, governance, creative) and belong in the cross-protocol integration section alongside accounts-and-agents.mdx. Content updated to reflect cross-protocol use and brand registry context.
