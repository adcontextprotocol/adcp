Add multi-select company types with "Data & Measurement" and "AI & Tech Platforms" categories (registry only)

- Organizations can now have multiple company types (e.g., Microsoft can be both "brand" and "ai")
- Added new company type categories: "data" (Data & Measurement) and "ai" (AI & Tech Platforms)
- Renamed "AI Infrastructure" to "AI & Tech Platforms" to include agent builders
- Created centralized company-types config for frontend and backend consistency
- Migration preserves existing single-value data while enabling multi-select
