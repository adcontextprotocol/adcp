Redesign industry news alerts for better engagement

**Paced single-article posting (replaces daily digest)**
- Quality 5 articles post immediately
- Quality 4 articles post only if channel has been quiet for 3+ hours
- Quality < 4 articles are ignored (not relevant enough for Slack or website)
- One article at a time to encourage discussion

**Community article amplification**
- When someone shares an article link in a managed channel, Addie reacts with :eyes:
- Article gets queued for processing through content pipeline
- After processing, Addie replies with her take to acknowledge the share
- Community shares appear on the website alongside RSS content

**Removed daily digest**
- No more batch digests - organic paced flow instead
- Each article gets its own post with Addie's spicy take
