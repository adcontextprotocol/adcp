Add membership tier selection to onboarding flow

Users can now explicitly select their membership tier during signup:
- Individual: Professional ($250/year) or Academic/Student/Non-profit ($50/year)
- Company: Company Membership ($2,500 or $10,000 based on revenue) or Industry Council Leader ($50,000/year)

This addresses user confusion where pricing was advertised but not selectable.
