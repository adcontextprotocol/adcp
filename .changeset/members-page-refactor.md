Refactor members page to remove pricing table and add URL filter support

- Replace full pricing grid with compact "Become a Member" banner linking to /membership
- Add URL query parameter support for filtering (e.g., /members?type=sales_agent)
- URL updates as users interact with filters for shareable/bookmarkable views
