<Warning>
**Draft Specification** — This protocol is under active development. APIs and schemas may change before the final release.
</Warning>

This document defines the Sponsored Intelligence (SI) Protocol specification. The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119).

## Protocol Overview

The SI Protocol defines how AI assistants (hosts) invoke and interact with brand agent endpoints to enable conversational brand experiences. The protocol consists of:

1. **Discovery** - How hosts discover brand agents and their capabilities
2. **Availability** - Anonymous pre-flight checks before session handoff
3. **Session Management** - Initiation, messaging, and termination
4. **Capability Negotiation** - Determining supported features
5. **UI Components** - Standard visual elements for rendering

## Transport Requirements

### Supported Transports

Brand agents MUST support at least one of the following transports:

| Transport | Protocol | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| MCP | Model Context Protocol | Tool-based interaction via JSON-RPC |
| A2A | Agent-to-Agent | Message-based interaction |

Brand agents SHOULD support MCP as the preferred transport.

### Transport Declaration

The SI manifest MUST declare supported transports:

```json
{
  "endpoint": {
    "transports": [
      { "type": "mcp", "url": "https://brand.example/mcp" }
    ],
    "preferred": "mcp"
  }
}
```

If multiple transports are declared, the manifest SHOULD include a `preferred` field.

## Discovery

### SI Manifest Location

Brand agents MUST publish their SI manifest at one of the following locations:

1. `/.well-known/si-manifest.json` (RECOMMENDED)
2. Referenced from `adagents.json` via the `si_manifest_url` field

### SI Manifest Schema

The SI manifest MUST conform to the `si-manifest.json` schema and MUST include:

- `endpoint` - Transport configuration
- `capabilities` - Supported modalities and components

The manifest SHOULD include:

- `brand_manifest_url` - Reference to brand identity assets

## Availability Check

### Purpose

The `si_check_availability` task provides an anonymous pre-flight check before session handoff. This allows hosts to verify offer/product availability without establishing a session.

### Requirements

Hosts MAY call `si_check_availability` before initiating a session.

If a host calls `si_check_availability`:

1. The request MUST NOT include user PII
2. The request MUST include at least one of: `offer_id` or `product_id`
3. Brand agents MUST return an `availability_token` if available
4. Brand agents SHOULD return a `ttl_seconds` indicating validity duration

### Availability Token Flow

If a host receives an `availability_token`:

1. The host SHOULD include this token in the subsequent `si_initiate_session` request
2. The brand agent MAY use the token to correlate pre-flight checks with sessions
3. The token MUST be treated as opaque by the host

```json
{
  "availability": {
    "token": "avail_abc123xyz",
    "checked_at": "2025-01-19T10:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

## Session Lifecycle

### Session States

SI sessions have the following states:

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `active` | Session is in progress |
| `pending_handoff` | Brand is requesting handoff to commerce flow |
| `complete` | Session has ended normally |

### Initiate Session

The `si_initiate_session` task establishes a new SI session.

#### Request Requirements

Hosts MUST include:

- `context` - Natural language description of user intent
- `identity` - User identity with consent status

Hosts SHOULD include:

- `supported_capabilities` - Host's capability set for negotiation
- `availability` - Token from pre-flight check if performed

Hosts MAY include:

- `media_buy_id` - AdCP media buy ID if triggered by advertising
- `offer_id` - Brand-specific offer to apply
- `placement` - Where this session was triggered

#### Response Requirements

Brand agents MUST return:

- `session_id` - Unique identifier for this session

Brand agents SHOULD return:

- `response.message` - Initial conversational message
- `negotiated_capabilities` - Intersection of brand and host capabilities

### Send Message

The `si_send_message` task exchanges messages within an active session.

#### Request Requirements

Hosts MUST include:

- `session_id` - Active session identifier

Hosts MUST include one of:

- `message` - User's text message
- `action_response` - Response to a UI action

#### Response Requirements

Brand agents MUST return:

- `session_id` - The session identifier
- `session_status` - Current session state (`active`, `pending_handoff`, or `complete`)

Brand agents SHOULD return:

- `response.message` - Conversational response

If `session_status` is `pending_handoff`, the response MUST include:

- `handoff` - Handoff configuration for commerce flow

### Terminate Session

The `si_terminate_session` task ends an SI session.

#### Request Requirements

Hosts MUST include:

- `session_id` - Session to terminate
- `reason` - Termination reason

#### Termination Reasons

| Reason | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `handoff_transaction` | User proceeding to purchase |
| `handoff_complete` | Conversation completed successfully |
| `user_exit` | User ended the session |
| `session_timeout` | Session timed out due to inactivity |
| `host_terminated` | Host ended the session (policy/error) |

## Capability Negotiation

### Negotiation Process

1. Brand declares capabilities in SI manifest
2. Host sends supported capabilities in session initiation
3. Brand returns negotiated (intersection) capabilities in response
4. Session uses only negotiated capabilities

### Capability Categories

#### Modalities

Modalities define interaction modes:

| Modality | Description | Required Support |
|----------|-------------|------------------|
| `conversational` | Text exchange | REQUIRED for all implementations |
| `voice` | Audio-based interaction | OPTIONAL |
| `video` | Video content playback | OPTIONAL |
| `avatar` | Animated video presence | OPTIONAL |

All SI implementations MUST support `conversational` modality.

#### Standard Components

The following components MUST be renderable by all compliant hosts:

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `text` | Conversational message |
| `link` | URL with label |
| `image` | Single image |
| `product_card` | Product display with CTA |
| `carousel` | Array of cards/images |
| `action_button` | CTA that triggers callback |

#### Extension Components

Hosts MAY support additional components:

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `app_handoff` | Platform-specific app handoff |
| `integration_actions` | MCP/A2A installation prompts |

Brand agents MUST NOT rely on extension components for core functionality.

## UI Element Requirements

### Standard Component Data

Each standard component MUST include the required fields as defined in `si-ui-element.json`:

**text**: `message` (required)

**link**: `url`, `label` (required); `preview` (optional)

**image**: `url`, `alt` (required); `caption` (optional)

**product_card**: `title`, `price` (required); `subtitle`, `image_url`, `description`, `badge`, `cta` (optional)

**carousel**: `items` (required); `title` (optional)

**action_button**: `label`, `action` (required); `payload` (optional)

### Action Handling

When a user interacts with an `action_button`:

1. The host MUST send an `action_response` via `si_send_message`
2. The `action_response` MUST include the `action` identifier
3. The `action_response` SHOULD include the `payload` if provided

### Integration Actions

The `integration_actions` component allows brand agents to offer persistent connections:

```json
{
  "type": "integration_actions",
  "data": {
    "actions": [
      { "type": "mcp", "label": "Add as MCP Tool", "highlighted": true },
      { "type": "a2a", "label": "Connect via A2A" }
    ]
  }
}
```

Hosts MAY render integration actions if they support the integration type.

## Identity and Privacy

### Consent Requirements

Hosts MUST obtain explicit user consent before sharing identity with brand agents.

The consent flow MUST:

1. Clearly identify what data will be shared
2. Reference the brand's privacy policy
3. Allow the user to decline

### Identity Object

When consent is granted, the `identity` object MUST include:

- `consent_granted: true`
- `consent_timestamp` - When consent was obtained
- `consent_scope` - Array of data types consented to
- `privacy_policy_acknowledged.brand_policy_url`

The `user` object MAY include:

- `email`
- `name`
- `locale`
- `shipping_address`

### Anonymous Sessions

If consent is not granted:

- `identity.consent_granted` MUST be `false`
- `identity.anonymous_session_id` SHOULD be provided
- No PII MUST be transmitted

## Commerce Integration

### ACP Handoff

When `session_status` is `pending_handoff` with `handoff.type: "transaction"`:

1. The host SHOULD initiate ACP checkout flow
2. The `handoff.intent` MUST describe the purchase intent
3. The `handoff.context_for_checkout` MAY include conversation context

### Commerce Actions

The `action_button` component MAY include commerce actions:

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `acp_checkout` | Initiate ACP checkout |
| `add_to_cart` | Add item to persistent cart |

## Error Handling

### Error Response

Brand agents MUST return errors in the `errors` array using the standard error schema:

```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "code": "session_not_found",
      "message": "Session has expired or does not exist"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Error Codes

| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `session_not_found` | Session ID is invalid or expired |
| `offer_unavailable` | Referenced offer is no longer available |
| `capability_unsupported` | Required capability not available |
| `rate_limited` | Too many requests |

## Security Considerations

### Transport Security

All SI communications MUST use HTTPS with TLS 1.2 or higher.

### Token Security

- Availability tokens MUST be opaque and unpredictable
- Session IDs MUST be unique and unpredictable
- Tokens SHOULD expire within a reasonable timeframe

### Data Minimization

- Hosts MUST NOT send PII without consent
- Brand agents SHOULD minimize data collection
- Session data SHOULD be deleted after termination

## Conformance

### Host Conformance

A conformant SI host MUST:

1. Support MCP transport
2. Render all standard components
3. Implement session lifecycle (initiate, send, terminate)
4. Obtain consent before sharing identity
5. Support capability negotiation

### Brand Agent Conformance

A conformant SI brand agent MUST:

1. Publish an SI manifest
2. Support at least one specified transport
3. Support conversational modality
4. Return valid session IDs
5. Handle all termination reasons
