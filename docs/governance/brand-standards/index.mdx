**AdCP 3.0 Proposal** - This protocol is under development for AdCP 3.0. Feedback welcome via [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/adcontextprotocol/adcp/discussions).
</Info>

Brand Standards governance enables buyers to declare brand requirements that governance agents use to automatically apply appropriate rules across advertising workflows.

## Overview

Brand Standards addresses three concerns:

| Concern | Description | Mechanism |
|---------|-------------|-----------|
| **Brand Identity** | Who is the advertiser? | Brand manifest declarations |
| **Creative Guidelines** | What can the brand show? | Creative constraints and policies |
| **Audience Constraints** | Who should see the ads? | Industry-specific targeting rules |

## Brand Manifest

The brand manifest is the core declaration that buyers provide to governance agents:

```json
{
  "brand_manifest": {
    "brand_name": "ToyBrand",
    "industry": "toys",
    "target_audience": "children_under_13",
    "prohibited_categories": ["gambling", "alcohol", "tobacco"],
    "creative_guidelines": {
      "max_animation_duration": 15,
      "require_accessibility": true
    }
  }
}
```

When governance agents receive a brand manifest, they automatically apply:

- **Regulatory compliance**: COPPA for children's brands, GDPR consent requirements
- **Content filtering**: Block categories inappropriate for the brand's audience
- **Creative validation**: Enforce brand-specific creative guidelines

## Integration with Property Governance

Brand manifests work alongside property lists. When creating a property list, include the brand manifest to get automatic rule application:

```json
{
  "tool": "create_property_list",
  "arguments": {
    "name": "ToyBrand Q1 Properties",
    "base_properties": [
      {
        "selection_type": "publisher_tags",
        "publisher_domain": "kidsmedia.com",
        "tags": ["kids_family", "educational"]
      }
    ],
    "filters": {
      "countries_all": ["US"],
      "channels_any": ["display", "video"],
      "feature_requirements": [
        { "feature_id": "brand_safety", "min_value": 90, "max_value": 100 }
      ]
    },
    "brand_manifest": {
      "brand_name": "ToyBrand",
      "industry": "toys",
      "target_audience": "children_under_13"
    }
  }
}
```

The governance agent uses the brand manifest to apply COPPA requirements, filter out non-child-safe properties, and enforce relevant industry rules.

## Coming Soon

Detailed specification and task definitions for Brand Standards governance are under development. Key planned features:

- **Brand manifest validation**: Verify manifest completeness and consistency
- **Industry rule sets**: Pre-defined rules for common industries (toys, alcohol, pharmaceuticals, finance)
- **Creative compliance**: Validate creatives against brand guidelines
- **Audience verification**: Ensure targeting complies with brand audience constraints
