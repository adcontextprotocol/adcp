## Scope-Based Selection

Creative standards can vary by:

- **Country**: Regional variations in brand presentation
- **Channel**: Display vs. video vs. native requirements
- **Product**: Different product lines may have distinct brand expressions
- **Campaign**: Special campaigns may have temporary variations

Request the appropriate `standards_id` based on the creative's intended use.

## Policy Prompts

The policy fields (`logo_policy`, `color_policy`, etc.) use natural language descriptions rather than keyword lists. This enables:

- **AI evaluation**: Language models can interpret guidelines contextually
- **Nuanced judgments**: Handle edge cases that rule-based systems miss
- **Human readability**: Same policies work for human reviewers
- **Easy updates**: Marketing teams can update policies without technical changes
