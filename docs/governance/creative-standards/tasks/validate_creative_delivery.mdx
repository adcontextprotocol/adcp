## Batch Processing

For large creative libraries:

- Maximum 1,000 creatives per request
- Process in batches for larger sets
- Use `include_passed: false` to reduce response size when only failures matter
- Use `feature_ids` to focus on specific compliance aspects

## Use Cases

### Post-Campaign Audit
Validate all creatives that ran during a campaign:

```json
{
  "standards_id": "acme_global_2024",
  "creatives": [...], // All creatives from campaign
  "include_passed": true  // Full audit report
}
```

### Pre-Flight Check
Validate creatives before launch:

```json
{
  "standards_id": "acme_global_2024",
  "creatives": [...], // Creatives pending approval
  "include_passed": false  // Only show problems
}
```

### Compliance Monitoring
Regular checks of active creative library:

```json
{
  "standards_id": "acme_global_2024",
  "creatives": [...], // Random sample or full library
  "feature_ids": ["logo_present", "approved_tagline"]  // Focus areas
}
```

## Error Response

```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "code": "BATCH_TOO_LARGE",
      "message": "Request contains 1500 creatives, maximum is 1000"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Partial Failures

If some creatives fail to evaluate, results include both successful evaluations and errors:

```json
{
  "summary": {
    "total_creatives": 100,
    "passed_creatives": 95,
    "failed_creatives": 3,
    "error_creatives": 2
  },
  "results": [...],
  "errors": [
    {
      "creative_id": "creative_099",
      "code": "ASSET_UNAVAILABLE",
      "message": "Could not fetch main asset"
    }
  ]
}
```
