</Info>

Creative Governance standardizes how creatives are evaluated by specialized governance agents. It applies the same feature-based pattern as [Property Governance](../property/index) — agents declare features they can evaluate, accept creative manifests, and return feature values.

## Overview

Creative governance agents evaluate creatives and return feature values. Different agents evaluate different features:

| Agent type | Example features | Feature type |
|------------|-----------------|--------------|
| **Security scanner** | `auto_redirect`, `credential_harvest`, `cloaking` | Binary |
| **Creative quality** | `brand_consistency`, `platform_optimized`, `creative_quality_score` | Quantitative, binary |
| **Content categorization** | `iab_casinos_gambling`, `iab_automotive` | Binary (with confidence) |

The protocol doesn't define a fixed feature taxonomy. Vendors declare what they evaluate via [`get_adcp_capabilities`](/docs/protocol/get_adcp_capabilities) and compete on coverage.

## How it works

### 1. Agent declares features

A creative governance agent advertises its capabilities using the same feature definition pattern as property governance:

<CodeGroup>
```json Security scanner
{
  "governance": {
    "creative_features": [
      {
        "feature_id": "auto_redirect",
        "type": "binary",
        "description": "Unauthorized navigation away from publisher context without user interaction",
        "methodology_url": "https://scanner.example.com/methodology"
      },
      {
        "feature_id": "credential_harvest",
        "type": "binary",
        "description": "Phishing techniques to gather user credentials or PII",
        "methodology_url": "https://scanner.example.com/methodology"
      },
      {
        "feature_id": "cloaking",
        "type": "binary",
        "description": "Creative masks or misrepresents content to evade detection",
        "methodology_url": "https://scanner.example.com/methodology"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

```json Creative quality platform
{
  "governance": {
    "creative_features": [
      {
        "feature_id": "brand_consistency",
        "type": "quantitative",
        "range": { "min": 0, "max": 100 },
        "description": "Adherence to brand guidelines including logo placement, colors, and typography",
        "methodology_url": "https://quality.example.com/methodology"
      },
      {
        "feature_id": "platform_optimized",
        "type": "binary",
        "description": "Creative meets platform-specific best practices (aspect ratio, text overlay limits)",
        "methodology_url": "https://quality.example.com/methodology"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

```json Content categorizer
{
  "governance": {
    "creative_features": [
      {
        "feature_id": "iab_casinos_gambling",
        "type": "binary",
        "description": "Creative contains casinos or gambling content (IAB Content Taxonomy 3.1, ID 181)",
        "methodology_url": "https://categorizer.example.com/methodology"
      },
      {
        "feature_id": "iab_automotive",
        "type": "binary",
        "description": "Creative contains automotive content (IAB Content Taxonomy 3.1, ID 1)",
        "methodology_url": "https://categorizer.example.com/methodology"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
</CodeGroup>

### 2. Orchestrator evaluates a creative

The orchestrator calls [`get_creative_features`](./get_creative_features) with a creative manifest:

```json
{
  "creative_manifest": {
    "format_id": {
      "agent_url": "https://creative.adcontextprotocol.org",
      "id": "html5-display-300x250"
    },
    "assets": {
      "creative_html": {
        "url": "https://cdn.agency.com/creative/abc123.html"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Agent returns feature values

The agent evaluates the creative and returns feature values. The response shape is the same regardless of agent type:

```json
{
  "results": [
    { "feature_id": "auto_redirect", "value": true, "confidence": 0.97 },
    { "feature_id": "credential_harvest", "value": false },
    { "feature_id": "cloaking", "value": false }
  ],
  "detail_url": "https://scanner.example.com/reports/ctx_abc123"
}
```

### 4. Orchestrator applies requirements

The orchestrator evaluates the feature values against buyer-defined requirements — the same pattern as property list feature requirements:

- Security: reject if `auto_redirect` is `true`
- Quality: reject if `brand_consistency` is below 80
- Categorization: reject if `iab_casinos_gambling` is `true` and campaign excludes gambling

## Design principles

**Reuses existing patterns.** Creative governance follows the same feature-based model as property governance. Agents declare features, return values, and keep detailed intelligence behind `detail_url` and `methodology_url`.

**Vendor-agnostic features.** The protocol doesn't define which features exist. Vendors declare their own feature catalogs. A security vendor and a creative quality vendor both use `get_creative_features` — the protocol doesn't need to know the difference.

**Opaque results.** Feature values on the wire are pass/fail (binary) or scores (quantitative). Detailed methodology, detection techniques, and threat intelligence stay behind the vendor's access-controlled URLs.

**Orchestrator decides.** Agents return values, orchestrators evaluate against requirements. The separation of measurement from decision-making is the same as property governance.

## Async evaluation

If evaluation takes time (e.g., sandboxed execution for malware scanning), the agent returns `status: "working"` and delivers results via the standard webhook mechanism. No custom status values or webhook events needed — the existing [async task pattern](/docs/building/implementation/async-operations) handles this.
