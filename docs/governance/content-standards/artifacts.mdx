# Artifacts

An **artifact** is a unit of content adjacent to an ad placement. When evaluating brand safety and suitability, you're asking: "Is this artifact appropriate for my brand's ads?"

## What Is an Artifact?

Artifacts represent the content context where an ad appears:

- A **news article** on a website
- A **podcast segment** between ad breaks
- A **video chapter** in a YouTube video
- A **social media post** in a feed
- A **scene** in a CTV show
- An **AI-generated image** in a chat conversation

Artifacts are identified by `property_id` + `artifact_id` - the property defines where the content lives, and the artifact_id is the property owner's identifier for that specific piece of content.

## Structure

**Schema**: [artifact.json](https://adcontextprotocol.org/schemas/v2/content-standards/artifact.json)

```json
{
  "property_id": {"type": "domain", "value": "reddit.com"},
  "artifact_id": "r_fitness_post_abc123",
  "language": "en",
  "title": "Best protein sources for muscle building",
  "assets": [
    {"type": "text", "role": "heading", "content": "Best protein sources for muscle building", "heading_level": 1},
    {"type": "text", "role": "paragraph", "content": "Looking for recommendations on high-quality protein sources..."},
    {"type": "image", "url": "https://cdn.reddit.com/fitness-image.jpg", "alt_text": "Person lifting weights"}
  ]
}
```

### Required Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `property_id` | Where this artifact lives - uses standard identifier types (`domain`, `app_id`, `apple_podcast_id`, etc.) |
| `artifact_id` | Unique identifier within the property - the property owner defines their scheme |

### Optional Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `assets` | Content in document order - text blocks, images, video, audio |
| `title` | Artifact title or headline |
| `language` | BCP 47 language tag |
| `format_id` | Reference to format registry (same as creative formats) |
| `metadata` | Rich metadata (Open Graph, JSON-LD, author info) |

## Asset Types

Assets represent the actual content within an artifact:

### Text

```json
{"type": "text", "role": "heading", "content": "Article Title", "heading_level": 1}
{"type": "text", "role": "paragraph", "content": "The article body text..."}
{"type": "text", "role": "quote", "content": "A quoted statement"}
```

Roles: `paragraph`, `heading`, `caption`, `quote`, `list_item`

### Image

```json
{
  "type": "image",
  "url": "https://cdn.example.com/photo.jpg",
  "alt_text": "Description of the image"
}
```

### Video

```json
{
  "type": "video",
  "url": "https://cdn.example.com/video.mp4",
  "transcript": "Full transcript of the video content...",
  "duration_ms": 180000
}
```

### Audio

```json
{
  "type": "audio",
  "url": "https://cdn.example.com/podcast.mp3",
  "transcript": "Today we're discussing...",
  "duration_ms": 3600000
}
```

## Secured Asset Access

Many assets aren't publicly accessible - AI-generated images, private conversations, paywalled content. The artifact schema supports authenticated access.

### Pre-Configuration (Recommended)

For ongoing partnerships, configure access once during onboarding rather than per-request:

1. **Service account sharing** - Grant the verification agent access to your cloud storage
2. **OAuth client credentials** - Set up machine-to-machine authentication
3. **API key exchange** - Share long-lived API keys during setup

This happens during the activation phase when the seller first receives content standards from a buyer.

### Per-Asset Authentication

When pre-configuration isn't possible, include access credentials with individual assets:

```json
{
  "type": "image",
  "url": "https://cdn.openai.com/secured/img_abc123.png",
  "access": {
    "method": "bearer_token",
    "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs..."
  }
}
```

### Access Methods

| Method | Use Case |
|--------|----------|
| `bearer_token` | OAuth2 bearer token in Authorization header |
| `service_account` | GCP/AWS service account credentials |
| `signed_url` | Pre-signed URL with embedded credentials (URL itself is the credential) |

### Service Account Setup

For GCP:

```json
{
  "access": {
    "method": "service_account",
    "provider": "gcp",
    "credentials": {
      "type": "service_account",
      "project_id": "my-project",
      "private_key_id": "...",
      "private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n...",
      "client_email": "verification-agent@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
    }
  }
}
```

For AWS:

```json
{
  "access": {
    "method": "service_account",
    "provider": "aws",
    "credentials": {
      "access_key_id": "AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE",
      "secret_access_key": "...",
      "region": "us-east-1"
    }
  }
}
```

### Pre-Signed URLs

For one-off access without sharing credentials:

```json
{
  "type": "video",
  "url": "https://storage.googleapis.com/bucket/video.mp4?X-Goog-Algorithm=GOOG4-RSA-SHA256&X-Goog-Credential=...&X-Goog-Signature=...",
  "access": {
    "method": "signed_url"
  }
}
```

The URL itself contains the credentials - no additional authentication needed.

## Property Identifier Types

The `property_id` uses standard identifier types from the AdCP property schema:

| Type | Example | Use Case |
|------|---------|----------|
| `domain` | `reddit.com` | Websites |
| `app_id` | `com.spotify.music` | Mobile apps |
| `apple_podcast_id` | `1234567890` | Apple Podcasts |
| `spotify_show_id` | `4rOoJ6Egrf8K2IrywzwOMk` | Spotify podcasts |
| `youtube_channel_id` | `UCddiUEpeqJcYeBxX1IVBKvQ` | YouTube channels |
| `rss_url` | `https://feeds.example.com/podcast.xml` | RSS feeds |

## Artifact ID Schemes

The property owner defines their artifact_id scheme. Examples:

| Property Type | Artifact ID Pattern | Example |
|---------------|---------------------|---------|
| News website | `article_{id}` | `article_12345` |
| Reddit | `r_{subreddit}_{post_id}` | `r_fitness_abc123` |
| Podcast | `episode_{num}_segment_{num}` | `episode_42_segment_2` |
| CTV | `show_{id}_s{season}e{episode}_scene_{num}` | `show_abc_s3e5_scene_12` |
| Social feed | `post_{id}` | `post_xyz789` |

The verification agent doesn't need to understand the scheme - it's opaque. The property owner uses it to correlate artifacts with their content.
