# calibrate_content

Collaborative calibration task for aligning on content standards interpretation. Used during setup to help sellers understand and internalize a buyer's content policies before campaign execution.

Unlike high-volume runtime evaluation, calibration is a **dialogue-based process** where parties exchange examples and explanations until aligned.

## When to Use

- **Seller onboarding**: When a seller first receives content standards from a buyer
- **Policy clarification**: When a seller needs to understand why specific content passes or fails
- **Model training**: When building a local model to run against the standards
- **Drift detection**: Periodic re-calibration to ensure continued alignment

## Request

**Schema**: [calibrate-content-request.json](https://adcontextprotocol.org/schemas/v2/content-standards/calibrate-content-request.json)

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `standards_id` | string | Yes | Standards configuration to calibrate against |
| `content` | content-context | Yes | Content context to evaluate |
| `context_id` | string | No | Continue an existing calibration dialogue |
| `feedback` | string | No | Seller's feedback or disagreement with previous response |

### Content Context

**Schema**: [content-context.json](https://adcontextprotocol.org/schemas/v2/content-standards/content-context.json)

```json
{
  "type": "domain",
  "value": "https://reddit.com/r/fitness/comments/abc123",
  "language": "en",
  "title": "Best protein sources for muscle building",
  "signals": [
    {"key": "iab_category", "value": "health/fitness", "confidence": 0.92}
  ],
  "text_content": [
    {"type": "heading", "heading": {"level": 1, "text": "Best protein sources for muscle building"}},
    {"type": "paragraph", "paragraphs": ["Looking for recommendations on high-quality protein sources...", "I've been lifting for 6 months and want to optimize my diet."]}
  ]
}
```

## Response

**Schema**: [calibrate-content-response.json](https://adcontextprotocol.org/schemas/v2/content-standards/calibrate-content-response.json)

### Passing Response

```json
{
  "context_id": "calib_abc123",
  "verdict": "pass",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "explanation": "This content aligns well with the brand's fitness-focused positioning. Health and fitness content is explicitly marked as 'ideal' in the policy. The discussion is constructive and educational.",
  "policy_alignment": {
    "matching_criteria": [
      "Sports and fitness content is ideal",
      "Lifestyle content about health is good"
    ],
    "no_violations": true
  },
  "features": [
    {
      "feature_id": "brand_safety",
      "status": "passed",
      "explanation": "No safety concerns. Content is user-generated but constructive fitness discussion."
    },
    {

      "status": "passed",
      "explanation": "Fitness content matches brand's athletic positioning."
    }
  ]
}
```

### Failing Response with Detailed Explanation

```json
{
  "context_id": "calib_def456",
  "verdict": "fail",
  "confidence": 0.88,
  "explanation": "This content discusses political topics which the policy explicitly excludes. While the article itself is balanced journalism, the brand has requested to avoid all controversial political content regardless of tone.",
  "policy_alignment": {
    "matching_criteria": [],
    "violations": [
      {
        "policy_text": "Avoid content about violence, controversial politics, adult themes",
        "violation_reason": "Article discusses ongoing political controversy"

    {
      "feature_id": "brand_suitability",
      "status": "failed",

      "suggestion": "Consider news content focused on sports, entertainment, or lifestyle instead."
    }
  ]
}
```

### Response Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `context_id` | Dialogue identifier for follow-up questions |
| `verdict` | Overall `pass` or `fail` decision |
| `confidence` | Model confidence in the verdict (0-1) |
| `explanation` | Detailed natural language explanation of the decision |
| `policy_alignment` | How the content maps to specific policy criteria |
| `features` | Per-feature breakdown with explanations |

## Dialogue Flow

Calibration supports back-and-forth dialogue via `context_id`:

```python
# Initial calibration request
response = verification_agent.calibrate_content(
    standards_id="nike_brand_safety",
    content={"type": "domain", "value": "https://reddit.com/r/news/politics"}
)
# Response: verdict=fail, context_id="calib_xyz"

# Seller disagrees - continue dialogue
response = verification_agent.calibrate_content(
    standards_id="nike_brand_safety",
    content={"type": "domain", "value": "https://reddit.com/r/news/politics"},
    context_id="calib_xyz",
    feedback="This is a factual news article, not opinion. Should balanced journalism be excluded?"
)
# Response: Clarifies that brand policy excludes ALL political content regardless of tone

# Seller acknowledges and tries different content
response = verification_agent.calibrate_content(
    standards_id="nike_brand_safety",
    content={"type": "domain", "value": "https://reddit.com/r/running"},
    context_id="calib_xyz"
)
# Response: verdict=pass - now seller understands the boundaries
```

## Calibration vs Runtime

| Aspect | calibrate_content | Runtime (local model) |
|--------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **Purpose** | Alignment & understanding | High-volume decisioning |
| **Volume** | Low (setup/periodic) | High (every impression) |
| **Response** | Verbose explanations | Pass/fail only |
| **Latency** | Seconds acceptable | Milliseconds required |
| **Dialogue** | Supports back-and-forth | Stateless |
