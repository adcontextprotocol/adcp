# Content Standards Protocol

The Content Standards Protocol controls *content safety and suitability* - what content contexts are appropriate for a brand's ads.

## What It Does

Content Standards agents evaluate placement contexts against brand policies. This enables:

- **Brand safety** - Is this content safe for *any* brand? (universal thresholds like hate speech, illegal content)
- **Brand suitability** - Is this content appropriate for *my* brand? (brand-specific preferences and tone)
- **Competitive separation** - Avoid appearing near competitor content

## Reference Pattern

When placing a media buy, reference your content standards:

```json
{
  "campaign": {...},
  "governance": {
    "content_standards": {
      "agent_url": "https://safety.ias.com/adcp",
      "standards_id": "nike_brand_safety",
      "token": "..."
    }
  }
}
```

- **agent_url** - The Content Standards service
- **standards_id** - Which standards configuration to use
- **token** - Access token (may be optional for public standards)

## Prompt-Based Policies

Content Standards uses **natural language prompts** rather than rigid keyword lists:

```json
{
  "policy": "Sports and fitness content is ideal. Lifestyle content about health is good. Entertainment is generally acceptable. Avoid content about violence, controversial politics, adult themes, or content portraying sedentary lifestyle positively. Block hate speech, illegal activities, or ongoing litigation against our company.",
  "calibration": {
    "acceptable": [
      {
        "type": "domain",
        "value": "https://espn.com/nba/story/_/championship-recap",
        "language": "en",
        "title": "Championship Game Recap",
        "signals": [
          {"key": "iab_category", "value": "sports/basketball", "confidence": 1.0}
        ],
        "text_content": [
          {"type": "heading", "heading": {"level": 1, "text": "Lakers Defeat Celtics in Thrilling Overtime"}},
          {"type": "paragraph", "paragraphs": ["In an exciting conclusion to the championship series..."]}
        ]
      },
      {
        "type": "domain",
        "value": "healthline.com",
        "language": "en",
        "signals": [{"key": "iab_category", "value": "health/fitness", "confidence": 0.95}]
      },
      {"type": "apple_podcast_id", "value": "1234567890", "language": "en"},
      {"type": "text", "value": "Championship game recap: Lakers defeat Celtics in thrilling overtime finish", "language": "en"},
      {"type": "image_url", "value": "https://cdn.example.com/sports/basketball-game.jpg"},
      {"type": "video_url", "value": "https://cdn.example.com/fitness/workout-tutorial.mp4"}
    ],
    "unacceptable": [
      {
        "type": "domain",
        "value": "tabloid.example.com",
        "language": "en",
        "signals": [{"key": "brand_safety", "value": "controversial", "confidence": 0.85}]
      },
      {"type": "rss_url", "value": "https://controversy.example.com/feed.xml", "language": "en"},
      {"type": "text", "value": "Political scandal rocks the nation as allegations surface", "language": "en"},
      {"type": "audio_url", "value": "https://cdn.example.com/news/controversial-podcast.mp3"}
    ]
  }
}
```

The policy prompt enables AI-powered verification agents to understand context and nuance. **Calibration** examples provide a training/test set that helps the agent interpret the policy correctly. Content contexts can include:

- **Domains** - Website identifiers with optional structured content
- **Podcast/RSS** - Audio content identifiers
- **Text snippets** - Sample headlines or content for NLP evaluation
- **Media URLs** - Links to images, audio, or video for multimodal evaluation
- **Signals** - Pre-computed classifications (IAB category, ratings, scores) with confidence levels
- **Structured content** - Headings, paragraphs, embedded media in document order

## Scoped Standards

Buyers typically maintain multiple standards configurations for different contexts - UK TV campaigns have different regulations than US display, and children's brands need stricter safety than adult beverages.

```json
{
  "standards_id": "coke_uk_tv_zero",
  "name": "UK TV - Coca-Cola zero-calorie brands",
  "brand_ids": ["coke_zero", "diet_coke"],
  "countries_all": ["GB"],
  "channels_any": ["ctv", "linear_tv"]
}
```

**The buyer selects the appropriate `standards_id` when creating a media buy.** The seller receives a reference to the resolved standards - they don't need to do scope matching themselves. These fields define where this standards configuration applies:

- **brand_ids**: References to brand identifiers defined in the [Brand Manifest](/docs/creative/brand-manifest). Brand names may differ across countries, so we use stable IDs rather than display names.
- **countries_all**: ISO country codes - standards apply in ALL listed countries (different jurisdictions have different regulations)
- **channels_any**: Advertising channels - standards apply to ANY of the listed channels

## Tasks

### Discovery

| Task | Description |

| [list_content_standards](/docs/governance/content-standards/tasks/list_content_standards) | List available standards configurations |
| [get_content_standards](/docs/governance/content-standards/tasks/get_content_standards) | Retrieve a specific standards configuration |

### Management

| Task | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [create_content_standards](/docs/governance/content-standards/tasks/create_content_standards) | Create a new standards configuration |
| [update_content_standards](/docs/governance/content-standards/tasks/update_content_standards) | Update an existing standards configuration |
| [delete_content_standards](/docs/governance/content-standards/tasks/delete_content_standards) | Delete a standards configuration |

### Evaluation

| Task | Description |

- **Custom** - Brand-specific implementations

## Evaluation Results

Evaluation tasks always return a **pass/fail verdict** and may optionally include feature-level details:

```json
{
  "verdict": "fail",
  "features": [
    {
      "feature_id": "brand_safety",
      "status": "passed",
      "value": "safe"
    },
    {
      "feature_id": "brand_suitability",
      "status": "failed",
      "message": "Content tone doesn't match brand guidelines"
    },
    {
      "feature_id": "competitor_adjacency",
      "status": "failed",
      "message": "Content mentions competitor brand"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Why Feature Breakdown Matters

Feature-level results help buyers understand *why* content was blocked:

- **Optimization**: Which rules cause the most blocking? Are your suitability criteria too strict?
- **Safety vs Suitability**: Distinguish universal brand safety blocks (hate speech, illegal content) from brand-specific suitability blocks (tone, competitive separation)
- **Debugging**: When using third-party standards like Scope3 Common Sense Brand Standards, identify which specific category caused the issue
- **Reporting**: Track block rates by feature to inform policy refinement
