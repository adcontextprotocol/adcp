# Content Standards Protocol

The Content Standards Protocol enables **privacy-preserving brand safety** for ephemeral and sensitive content that cannot leave a publisher's infrastructure.

## The Problem

Traditional brand safety relies on third-party verification: send your content to IAS or DoubleVerify, they evaluate it, return a verdict. This works for static web pages. It doesn't work for:

- **AI-generated content** - ChatGPT responses, DALL-E images that exist only in a user session
- **Private conversations** - Content in messaging apps, private social feeds
- **Ephemeral content** - Stories, live streams, real-time feeds that disappear
- **Privacy-regulated content** - GDPR-protected data that cannot be exported

These platforms can't send content to external verification services. But brands still need safety guarantees.

## The Solution: Calibration-Based Alignment

Content Standards solves this with a three-phase model where **no sensitive content leaves the publisher's walls**:

1. **Calibration** - Publisher and verification agent align on policy interpretation using synthetic or sample data
2. **Local Execution** - Publisher runs evaluation locally on every impression (content never leaves)
3. **Validation** - Statistical sampling detects drift; verification agent audits a sample

This inverts the traditional model. Instead of "send us your content, we'll evaluate it," it's "we'll teach you our standards, you evaluate locally, we'll audit statistically."

## What It Covers

- **Brand safety** - Is this content safe for *any* brand? (universal thresholds like hate speech, illegal content)
- **Brand suitability** - Is this content appropriate for *my* brand? (brand-specific preferences and tone)

## Key Concepts

Content standards evaluation involves four key questions that buyers and sellers negotiate:

1. **What content?** - What [artifacts](/docs/governance/content-standards/artifacts) to evaluate (the ad-adjacent content)
2. **How much adjacency?** - How many artifacts around the ad slot to consider
3. **What sampling rate?** - What percentage of traffic to evaluate
4. **How to calibrate?** - How to align on policy interpretation before runtime

These parameters are negotiated between buyer and seller during product discovery and media buy creation.

## Workflow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Brand
    participant Buyer as Buyer Agent
    participant Seller as Seller Agent
    participant Verifier as Verification Agent

    Note over Brand,Verifier: 1. SETUP PHASE
    Brand->>Verifier: create_content_standards (policy + calibration examples)
    Verifier-->>Brand: standards_id

    Note over Brand,Verifier: 2. ACTIVATION PHASE
    Brand->>Buyer: "Buy inventory from Reddit, use standards_id X"
    Buyer->>Seller: create_media_buy (includes content_standards reference)

    Seller->>Verifier: calibrate_content (sample artifacts)
    Verifier-->>Seller: verdict + explanation
    Seller->>Verifier: "What about this edge case?"
    Verifier-->>Seller: clarification
    Note over Seller: Seller builds local model

    Note over Brand,Verifier: 3. RUNTIME PHASE
    loop High-volume decisioning
        Note over Seller: Local model evaluates artifacts
    end

    Buyer->>Seller: get_media_buy_artifacts (sampled)
    Seller-->>Buyer: Content artifacts
    Buyer->>Verifier: validate_content_delivery
    Verifier-->>Buyer: Validation results
```

**Key insight**: Runtime decisioning happens locally at the seller (for scale). Buyers pull content samples from sellers and validate against the verification agent.

## Adjacency

How much content around the ad slot should be evaluated?

| Context | Adjacency Examples |
|---------|-------------------|
| **News article** | The article where the ad appears |
| **Social feed** | 1-2 posts above and below the ad slot |
| **Podcast** | The segment before and after the ad break |
| **CTV** | 1-2 scenes before and after the ad pod |
| **Infinite scroll** | Posts within the visible viewport |

Adjacency requirements are defined by the seller in their product catalog (`get_products`). The buyer can filter products based on adjacency guarantees:

```json
{
  "product_id": "reddit_feed_standard",
  "content_standards_adjacency_definition": {
    "before": 2,
    "after": 2,
    "unit": "posts"
  }
}
```

### Adjacency Units

| Unit | Use Case |
|------|----------|
| `posts` | Social feeds, forums, comment threads |
| `scenes` | CTV, streaming video content |
| `segments` | Podcasts, audio content |
| `seconds` | Time-based adjacency in video/audio |
| `viewports` | Infinite scroll contexts |
| `articles` | News sites, content aggregators |

Different products may offer different adjacency guarantees at different price points.

## Sampling Rate

What percentage of traffic should be evaluated by the verification agent?

| Rate | Use Case |
|------|----------|
| **100%** | Premium brand safety - every impression validated |
| **10-25%** | Standard monitoring - statistical confidence |
| **1-5%** | Spot checking - drift detection only |

Sampling rate is negotiated in the media buy:

```json
{
  "governance": {
    "content_standards": {
      "agent_url": "https://safety.ias.com/adcp",
      "standards_id": "nike_brand_safety",
      "sampling_rate": 0.25
    }
  }
}
```

Higher sampling rates typically cost more but provide stronger guarantees. The seller is responsible for implementing the agreed sampling rate and reporting actual coverage.

## Validation Thresholds

When a seller calibrates their local model against a verification agent, there's an expected drift - the local model won't match the verification agent 100% of the time. **Validation thresholds** define acceptable drift between local execution and validation samples.

Sellers advertise their content safety capabilities in their product catalog:

```json
{
  "product_id": "reddit_feed_premium",
  "content_standards": {
    "validation_threshold": 0.95,
    "validation_threshold_description": "Local model matches verification agent 95% of the time"
  }
}
```

| Threshold | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **0.99** | Premium - local model is 99% aligned with verification agent |
| **0.95** | Standard - local model is 95% aligned |
| **0.90** | Budget - local model is 90% aligned |

**This is a contractual guarantee.** If the seller's validation results show more drift than the advertised threshold, buyers can expect remediation (makegoods, refunds, etc.) just like any other delivery discrepancy.

The threshold answers the key buyer question: "If I accept your local model, how confident can I be that you're enforcing my standards correctly?"

## Policies

Content Standards uses **natural language prompts** rather than rigid keyword lists:

```json
{
  "policy": "Sports and fitness content is ideal. Lifestyle content about health is good. Entertainment is generally acceptable. Avoid content about violence, controversial politics, adult themes, or content portraying sedentary lifestyle positively. Block hate speech, illegal activities, or ongoing litigation against our company.",
  "calibration_exemplars": {
    "pass": [
      {
        "property_id": {"type": "domain", "value": "espn.com"},
        "artifact_id": "nba_championship_recap_2024",
        "assets": [{"type": "text", "role": "title", "content": "Championship Game Recap"}]
      }
    ],
    "fail": [
      {
        "property_id": {"type": "domain", "value": "tabloid.example.com"},
        "artifact_id": "scandal_story_123",
        "assets": [{"type": "text", "role": "title", "content": "Celebrity Scandal Exposed"}]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The policy prompt enables AI-powered verification agents to understand context and nuance. **Calibration** examples provide a training/test set that helps the agent interpret the policy correctly.

See [Artifacts](/docs/governance/content-standards/artifacts) for details on artifact structure and secured asset access.

## Scoped Standards

Buyers typically maintain multiple standards configurations for different contexts - UK TV campaigns have different regulations than US display, and children's brands need stricter safety than adult beverages.

```json
{
  "standards_id": "coke_uk_tv_zero",
  "name": "UK TV - Coca-Cola zero-calorie brands",
  "brand_ids": ["coke_zero", "diet_coke"],
  "countries_all": ["GB"],
  "channels_any": ["ctv", "linear_tv"]
}
```

**The buyer selects the appropriate `standards_id` when creating a media buy.** The seller receives a reference to the resolved standards - they don't need to do scope matching themselves.

## Calibration

Before running campaigns, sellers calibrate their local models against the verification agent. This is a **dialogue-based process** that may involve human review on either side:

1. Seller sends sample artifacts to the verification agent
2. Verification agent returns verdicts with detailed explanations
3. Seller asks follow-up questions about edge cases
4. Process repeats until alignment is achieved

**Human-in-the-loop**: Calibration often involves humans on both sides. A brand safety specialist at the buyer might review edge cases flagged by the verification agent. A content operations team at the seller might curate calibration samples and validate the local model's learning. The protocol supports async workflows where either party can pause for human review before responding.

```json
// Seller: "Does this pass?"
{
  "artifact": {
    "property_id": {"type": "domain", "value": "reddit.com"},
    "artifact_id": "r_news_politics_123",
    "assets": [{"type": "text", "role": "title", "content": "Political News Article"}]
  }
}

// Verification agent: "No, because..."
{
  "verdict": "fail",
  "explanation": "Political content is excluded by brand policy, even when balanced.",
  "policy_alignment": {
    "violations": [{
      "policy_text": "Avoid content about controversial politics",
      "violation_reason": "Article discusses ongoing political controversy"
    }]
  }
}
```
