# Content Standards Protocol

The Content Standards Protocol controls *content safety and suitability* - what content contexts are appropriate for a brand's ads.

## What It Does

Content Standards agents evaluate placement contexts against brand policies. This enables:

- **Brand safety** - Is this content safe for *any* brand? (universal thresholds like hate speech, illegal content)
- **Brand suitability** - Is this content appropriate for *my* brand? (brand-specific preferences and tone)
- **Competitive separation** - Avoid appearing near competitor content

## Reference Pattern

When placing a media buy, reference your content standards:

```json
{
  "campaign": {...},
  "governance": {
    "content_standards": {
      "agent_url": "https://safety.ias.com/adcp",
      "standards_id": "nike_brand_safety",
      "token": "..."
    }
  }
}
```

- **agent_url** - The Content Standards service
- **standards_id** - Which standards configuration to use
- **token** - Access token (may be optional for public standards)

## Prompt-Based Policies

Content Standards uses **natural language prompts** rather than rigid keyword lists:

```json
{
  "policy": "Sports and fitness content is ideal. Lifestyle content about health is good. Entertainment is generally acceptable. Avoid content about violence, controversial politics, adult themes, or content portraying sedentary lifestyle positively. Block hate speech, illegal activities, or ongoing litigation against our company.",
  "examples": {
    "acceptable": [
      "https://espn.com/nba/game-recap",
      "https://healthline.com/nutrition/healthy-eating"
    ],
    "unacceptable": [
      "https://news.example.com/political-controversy",
      "https://tabloid.example.com/celebrity-scandal"
    ]
  }
}
```

The policy prompt enables AI-powered verification agents to understand context and nuance. Examples provide a training set that helps calibrate the agent's interpretation.

## Scoped Standards

Standards are scoped by country, brand, channel, and product:

```json
{
  "standards_id": "coke_uk_tv_zero",
  "scope": {
    "brands": ["Coca-Cola Zero", "Diet Coke"],
    "countries": ["GB"],
    "channels": ["ctv", "linear_tv"],
    "products": ["zero-calorie beverages"],
    "description": "UK TV - zero-calorie beverages"
  }
}
```

This allows different standards for different contexts (e.g., UK TV has different regulations than US display).

## Tasks

| Task | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [list_content_features](/docs/governance/content-standards/tasks/list_content_features) | Discover features the agent can evaluate |
| [get_content_standards](/docs/governance/content-standards/tasks/get_content_standards) | Retrieve content safety policies |
| [check_content](/docs/governance/content-standards/tasks/check_content) | Evaluate a single content context |
| [validate_content_delivery](/docs/governance/content-standards/tasks/validate_content_delivery) | Batch validation of delivery records |

## Typical Providers

- **IAS** - Integral Ad Science
- **DoubleVerify** - Brand safety and verification
- **Scope3** - Sustainability-focused brand safety with prompt-based policies
- **Custom** - Brand-specific implementations

## Feature-Based Results

All verification tasks return **feature-based results** rather than simple pass/fail:

```json
{
  "summary": {
    "total_features": 5,
    "passed_features": 4,
    "failed_features": 1
  },
  "results": [
    {
      "feature_id": "brand_safety",
      "status": "passed",
      "value": "safe"
    },
    {
      "feature_id": "competitor_adjacency",
      "status": "failed",
      "message": "Content mentions competitor brand",
      "suggestion": "Avoid placements on this page"
    }
  ]
}
```
