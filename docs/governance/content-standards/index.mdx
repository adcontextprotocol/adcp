# Content Standards Protocol

The Content Standards Protocol controls *content safety and suitability* - what content contexts are appropriate for a brand's ads.

## What It Does

Content Standards agents evaluate placement contexts against brand safety policies. This enables:

- **Brand safety verification** - Is this content safe for the brand?
- **Suitability scoring** - How well does this content fit the brand?
- **Competitive separation** - Avoid appearing near competitor content
- **Sentiment analysis** - Content tone and mood evaluation

## Reference Pattern

When placing a media buy, reference your content standards:

```json
{
  "campaign": {...},
  "governance": {
    "content_standards": {
      "agent_url": "https://safety.ias.com/adcp",
      "standards_id": "nike_brand_safety",
      "token": "..."
    }
  }
}
```

- **agent_url** - The Content Standards service
- **standards_id** - Which standards configuration to use
- **token** - Access token (may be optional for public standards)

## Prompt-Based Policies

Content Standards uses **natural language prompts** rather than rigid keyword lists:

```json
{
  "policy": "Avoid content about violence, controversial politics, or adult themes. Sports news is excellent. Entertainment is generally acceptable. Avoid hard news unless positive sentiment.",

  "exclusions_prompt": "Block content containing hate speech, illegal activities, explicit adult content, or ongoing litigation against our company.",

  "context_evaluation_prompt": "Consider the overall tone. Sports and fitness content is ideal. Lifestyle content about health is good. Avoid content portraying sedentary lifestyle positively."
}
```

This enables AI-powered verification agents to understand context and nuance.

## Scoped Standards

Standards are scoped by country, brand, channel, and product:

```json
{
  "standards_id": "coke_uk_tv_zero",
  "scope": {
    "brands": ["Coca-Cola Zero", "Diet Coke"],
    "countries": ["GB"],
    "channels": ["ctv", "linear_tv"],
    "products": ["zero-calorie beverages"],
    "description": "UK TV - zero-calorie beverages"
  }
}
```

This allows different standards for different contexts (e.g., UK TV has different regulations than US display).

## Tasks

| Task | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [list_content_features](/docs/governance/content-standards/tasks/list_content_features) | Discover features the agent can evaluate |
| [get_content_standards](/docs/governance/content-standards/tasks/get_content_standards) | Retrieve content safety policies |
| [check_content](/docs/governance/content-standards/tasks/check_content) | Evaluate a single content context |
| [validate_content_delivery](/docs/governance/content-standards/tasks/validate_content_delivery) | Batch validation of delivery records |

## Typical Providers

- **IAS** - Integral Ad Science
- **DoubleVerify** - Brand safety and verification
- **Scope3** - Sustainability-focused brand safety with prompt-based policies
- **Custom** - Brand-specific implementations

## Feature-Based Results

All verification tasks return **feature-based results** rather than simple pass/fail:

```json
{
  "summary": {
    "total_features": 5,
    "passed_features": 4,
    "failed_features": 1
  },
  "results": [
    {
      "feature_id": "brand_safety",
      "status": "passed",
      "value": "safe"
    },
    {
      "feature_id": "competitor_adjacency",
      "status": "failed",
      "message": "Content mentions competitor brand",
      "suggestion": "Avoid placements on this page"
    }
  ]
}
```
