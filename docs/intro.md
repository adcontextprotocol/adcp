# Getting Started with Ad Context Protocol

Welcome to the Ad Context Protocol (ACP) documentation. ACP enables AI assistants to interact with advertising platforms through standardized interfaces.

## What is Ad Context Protocol?

Ad Context Protocol is an open standard based on the Model Context Protocol (MCP) that allows:

- **Natural Language Interaction**: Describe what you want in plain English
- **Platform Agnostic**: Works with any compatible advertising platform
- **AI-Powered**: Designed for integration with AI assistants like Claude, GPT, and others

## Quick Example

Instead of navigating multiple platforms, you can now say:

> "Find audiences of premium sports enthusiasts who would be interested in high-end running shoes, activate them on Scope3, and set up daily usage reporting."

The AI assistant will:
1. Search for relevant audiences across connected platforms
2. Show you options with transparent pricing
3. Activate your chosen audiences
4. Set up automated reporting

## Available Protocols

### 🎯 [Audience Discovery Protocol](./audience/overview)
**Status**: v1.0 Available

### 📍 Curation Protocol
**Status**: Coming Q2 2025

### 💰 Media Buy Protocol  
**Status**: Coming Q3 2025

Execute and optimize media buys programmatically.
