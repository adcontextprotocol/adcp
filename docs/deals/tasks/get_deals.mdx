## Understanding the Response

### Platform Availability

Each deal includes a `platforms` array listing the SSP platforms where it can be activated:
- Deals must be available on at least one platform
- Use the `activate_deal` task to activate the deal on your chosen platform(s)
- Same deal can be activated on multiple platforms if listed

### Deal Status

- **"draft"**: Deal is proposed but not yet activated (typical for newly discovered deals)
- **"active"**: Deal is activated and ready to serve
- **"inactive"**: Deal is no longer available or has been deactivated

### Pricing Types

**Floor Pricing** (`type: "Floor"`):
- Minimum CPM price
- Buyers can bid above the floor in auctions
- Common in PMP deals with competitive bidding

**Fixed Pricing** (`type: "Fixed"`):
- Exact CPM price, no bidding
- Predictable costs, guaranteed rate
- Common in guaranteed deals

**Market Pricing** (`type: "Market"`):
- Market-rate pricing determined at impression time
- Dynamic pricing based on demand
- No fixed CPM in response

### Curated Deal Margins

Curated deals include a margin on top of media costs:
- **Percentage margin**: Applied as percentage of media cost (e.g., 15% on $15 CPM = $17.25 total)
- **CPM margin**: Fixed CPM added to media cost (e.g., $2 CPM margin on $15 CPM = $17 total)

## Integration with Signals Protocol

### Signal-Enhanced Targeting

The `include_segments` and `exclude_segments` fields can reference signal IDs obtained by the Deals Agent from Signals Agents:

```json
{
  "targeting": {
    "include_segments": [
      "luxury_auto_intenders_v2",  // Signal ID from Signals Agent
      "high_income_households"     // Another signal ID
    ],
    "exclude_segments": [
      "competitor_customers"        // Exclusion signal
    ]
  }
}
```

**Important**: The Buyer Agent does not directly interact with Signals Agents. The Deals Agent integrates with Signals Agents behind the scenes and includes signal-based targeting in returned deals.

## Use Cases

### Discovery by Objectives

```json
{
  "deal_spec": "High-impact display placements for luxury brand awareness in premium environments"
}
```

The Deals Agent interprets the objectives and returns appropriate deals (likely curated packages with quality guarantees).

### Discovery with Constraints

```json
{
  "deal_spec": "Cost-efficient video scale for product launch, maximum $15 CPM, Q1 2026 availability"
}
```

Natural language spec includes all filtering criteria - no separate filters object needed.

### Discovery with Signal Integration

```json
{
  "deal_spec": "Premium video deals for automotive with luxury car intender audiences, US only"
}
```

The Deals Agent queries Signals Agents for relevant audiences and returns deals with those segments pre-configured in targeting.

## Error Handling

### Common Errors

- **DEAL_NOT_FOUND**: No deals match the specified criteria
- **INVALID_ADVERTISER**: Advertiser identifier not recognized or not authorized
- **DATE_CONFLICT**: Requested dates don't align with available deal inventory

### Warnings

- **PARTIAL_AVAILABILITY**: Some deals have limited inventory remaining
- **PRICING_UNAVAILABLE**: Pricing data temporarily unavailable for some deals

## Best Practices

1. **Use Descriptive Specifications**: Clear natural language descriptions help the agent find the most relevant deals
2. **Check Platform Availability**: Verify the deal is available on platforms you can access
3. **Review Targeting**: Understand what targeting is pre-applied before activation
4. **Verify Dates**: Ensure deal dates align with your campaign timing
5. **Compare Pricing**: Evaluate pricing types and margins across multiple deals
6. **Check Status**: Only "draft" or "active" deals can typically be activated

## Next Steps

After discovering deals, use the [`activate_deal`](/docs/deals/tasks/activate_deal) task to activate your selected deal on the appropriate SSP platform(s).
