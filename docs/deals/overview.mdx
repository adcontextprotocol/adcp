# Deals Protocol Overview

The Deals Protocol enables AI assistants to discover and activate pre-packaged and ad-hoc inventory deal packages from publishers and ad decisioning platforms through natural language—simplifying the complex landscape of programmatic deal buying.

## The Challenge: Navigating Deal Marketplaces

Modern programmatic advertising offers numerous deal opportunities across publishers and SSPs. While this provides access to premium inventory, it creates challenges:
- **Fragmented discovery**: Deals scattered across multiple SSPs and sellers
- **Varying deal structures**: PMPs, curated packages, guaranteed deals with different terms
- **Complex targeting**: Deals may include pre-applied audiences, context, or brand safety
- **Pricing opacity**: Floor vs. fixed pricing, margins, and package costs vary
- **Manual activation**: Setting up deals across SSPs is time-intensive

## How AI Assistants Transform Deal Discovery

### Current Approach
```
Human → Navigate multiple SSP UIs → Evaluate deal terms → Manual setup across platforms
```
- **Challenges**: Time-intensive, miss opportunities, requires platform expertise

### With Deals Protocol
```
Human describes objectives → AI discovers matching deals → Streamlined activation
```
- **Benefits**: Comprehensive discovery, transparent comparison, efficient activation

## The Power of AI-Assisted Deal Discovery

### AI Can Process and Compare Deals at Scale

```
Human: I need premium video inventory for automotive brand with
       guaranteed viewability and brand-safe context

AI: Analyzing 143 video deals across 8 publishers and 5 SSPs...

- Deal Type: Curated package
- SSP: Magnite
- Inventory: Top 15 automotive content sites
- Ad Format: Video (pre-roll and mid-roll)
- Pricing: $18 CPM fixed + 15% curation margin
- Targeting: Automotive context + auto intender audiences (optional)
- Brand Safety: IAS verification, blocked competitor categories

### Flexible Deal Structures

## From Fragmented Platforms to Unified Discovery

### Traditional Approach: Multi-Platform Navigation
- Log into multiple SSP platforms individually
- Manually search deal catalogs in each system
- Compare terms across different interfaces
- Set up deals individually on each SSP
- Track performance separately per platform

### Enhanced with Deals Protocol: AI-Powered Unified Access

## Deal Discovery with Natural Language

### Describing Deal Objectives

The AI assistant helps translate campaign objectives into deal criteria:

**Objective**: "I need high-impact display placements for luxury brand awareness"

**AI Translation**:
- Ad Type: Display (likely high-impact formats)
- Targeting: Affluent audiences, premium contexts
- Brand Alignment: Luxury-appropriate environments
- Deal Types: Likely curated packages with quality guarantees

**Objective**: "Cost-efficient video scale for product launch"

**AI Translation**:
- Ad Type: Video
- Pricing: Floor pricing or market-rate deals preferred
- Scale: Large impression volumes
- Deal Types: PMP deals or broad curation packages

### Intelligent Filtering and Recommendations

The AI assistant can:
- **Filter by constraints**: Budget, scale requirements, timing
- **Compare pricing models**: Floor vs. fixed, with/without margins
- **Evaluate targeting fit**: Match deal targeting to campaign objectives
- **Assess brand safety**: Verify appropriate controls are in place
- **Recommend combinations**: Multiple deals to achieve scale or coverage

## Integration with Signals Protocol

**Integration Architecture**: The Deals Agent integrates with Signals Agents behind the scenes. The Buyer Agent interacts only with the Deals Agent—not directly with Signals Agents.

```
Buyer Agent → Deals Agent → Signals Agent
   (Deals Protocol)  (Signals Protocol)
```

This is parallel to how the Media Buy Protocol works with Sales Agents.

### How Deals Agents Leverage Signals

When the Buyer Agent requests deals, the Deals Agent can:
- Discover relevant audience signals from integrated Signals Agents
- Include those signals in the targeting of returned deals
- Bundle audience targeting with inventory in curated packages
- Provide deals with pre-selected segments for brand safety or performance

### Signals-Enhanced Deals

```
Human (to Buyer Agent): Find video deals for luxury automotive brand

Buyer Agent → Deals Agent: get_deals request with automotive specifications

Deals Agent workflow:
1. Searches available video inventory deals
2. Queries integrated Signals Agents for relevant automotive audiences
3. Matches signals with appropriate inventory packages

Deals Agent → Buyer Agent: Returns deals including:
   → "Premium Video Curator - Auto Context" on Magnite
   → Includes automotive content + "Luxury Auto Intenders" segment
   → Targeting pre-configured with signal IDs from Signals Agent

Result: Buyer Agent receives deals with inventory + audience targeting combined
```

### Deals with Included Targeting

Deals can return targeting that includes:
- **Context-based signals**: Automotive content, premium publishers
- **Audience signals**: Segments obtained from Signals Agents (referenced by signal IDs)
- **Brand safety**: Block lists and allow lists for appropriate content
- **Geographic targeting**: Regional or local inventory packages

The Buyer Agent doesn't need to know how the Deals Agent obtained the signals—it just receives deals with targeting ready to use.

## Activation and Deployment

Once deals are discovered, activation is streamlined:

### Single-Platform Activation
```
Activate "Premium Video Bundle" on Magnite
→ Deal ID configured in SSP
→ Ready for buyers to access
```

### Multi-Platform Deployment
```
Activate "Cross-Publisher PMP" on:
- Pubmatic (seller account: publisher_abc)
- Index Exchange (seller account: publisher_abc)
→ Same deal available across both SSPs
→ Unified reporting and management
```

### Asynchronous Activation
Large or complex deals may require asynchronous activation:
```
Activate deal → Receive operation_id
→ Webhook notification when ready
→ Or poll for activation status
→ Use deal once deployed
```
