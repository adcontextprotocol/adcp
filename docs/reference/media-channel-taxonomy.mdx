# Media Channel Taxonomy

<Info>
**Status**: Draft Specification
**Version**: 1.0.0-draft
**Last Updated**: 2026-01-23
</Info>

This specification defines a standardized taxonomy for advertising media channels. It is designed for interoperability across media planning tools, ad tech platforms, and AI-powered advertising agents.

## Motivation

The advertising industry lacks a standardized channel taxonomy. While IAB Tech Lab provides taxonomies for content, audience, and ad products, no equivalent exists for media channels. This leads to:

- Inconsistent channel naming across platforms
- Difficulty aggregating cross-channel campaign data
- Confusion between channels, formats, and buying models
- Friction in automated media planning workflows

This specification addresses these gaps by defining:

1. **Media Channels** - How buyers allocate budget (planning abstractions)
2. **Property Types** - Addressable inventory surfaces with verifiable ownership
3. **Clear distinction** between channels, property types, and formats

## Design Philosophy

**Channels represent how buyers plan and allocate budget**, not where ads technically render.

This is a deliberate design choice. Buyers don't say "I have $500K for web" — they say "I have $500K for display" or "I have $300K for OLV." The channel taxonomy reflects this reality.

### Key Principles

1. **Planning-oriented**: Channels match how agencies structure media plans
2. **Lightweight tags**: Channels help buyers express intent, not enforce precise classification
3. **Multi-channel support**: Properties may align with multiple channels (YouTube = `olv`, `social`, `ctv`)
4. **Publisher-declared**: Publishers indicate which channels their inventory supports
5. **Agent-reconciled**: Sales agents match buyer intent with publisher claims

### Channels vs Technical Substrates

Channels deliberately avoid substrate-level concepts like "web" or "mobile app" because:
- Buyers don't plan that way
- Most digital inventory would fall into both categories
- The same placement can be bought different ways

Instead, channels describe **buying contexts**: display, OLV, social, search, CTV, etc.

## Terminology

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119).

## Definitions

### Media Channel

A **media channel** describes how buyers allocate budget. It represents a planning abstraction that encodes assumptions about audience, environment, and buying approach.

Channels are defined by **buying context**, not by:
- Technical substrate (web vs app)
- How the ad looks (that's a **format**)
- The specific technology serving the ad

### Property Type

A **property type** describes a specific addressable inventory surface where:
- Ownership can be verified (e.g., via `adagents.json`)
- Ads can be programmatically served
- Identifiers exist for the property (domains, app IDs, device IDs)

Property types are technical classifications, distinct from channels. The same property may support multiple channels.

### Format Category

A **format category** describes HOW an ad renders - its creative unit type. Examples: `video`, `audio`, `display`, `native`. Formats are orthogonal to channels.

## Understanding Channels vs Property Types

| Concept | Question It Answers | Determined By | Example |
|---------|---------------------|---------------|---------|
| **Channel** | How do buyers allocate budget? | Planning context | `retail_media` |
| **Property Type** | Where does the ad technically render? | Addressable inventory surface | `website` |

### Why This Matters

Consider retail media: when a buyer allocates budget to "retail media," they're buying:
1. Sponsored products on retailer websites
2. Display ads on retailer apps
3. Off-site ads using retailer data
4. In-store digital screens

All of these are `retail_media` channel, but the property types vary (`website`, `mobile_app`, `dooh`).

<Note>
Some names like `dooh`, `podcast`, `radio`, and `streaming_audio` appear as both a channel and a property type. The channel describes the **buying context** (how budget is allocated); the property type describes the **technical surface** (where the ad renders). For example, an in-store retail screen is `retail_media` channel / `dooh` property type, while a standalone digital billboard is `dooh` channel / `dooh` property type.
</Note>

### Multi-Channel Properties

Properties can align with multiple channels. Examples:

| Property | Channels | Reasoning |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| YouTube | `olv`, `social`, `ctv` | Different buying contexts on same platform |
| ESPN App | `olv`, `display` | Supports video and display inventory |
| Amazon | `retail_media`, `search`, `display` | Multiple ad products |

### When to Use Each

**Use channel when:**
- Filtering products by budget allocation category
- Reporting on media mix
- Expressing buyer intent in product discovery

**Use property_type when:**
- Validating inventory ownership via `adagents.json`
- Technical ad serving decisions
- Platform-specific targeting

## Property Types

Property types describe addressable inventory surfaces with verifiable ownership. They are used in `adagents.json` for authorization validation.

### Property Type Enum

| Property Type | Description | Example Channels |
|---------------|-------------|------------------|
| `website` | Web properties accessible via browser | `display`, `olv` |
| `mobile_app` | Native mobile applications | `display`, `olv`, `social`, `gaming` |
| `ctv_app` | Connected TV applications | `ctv` |
| `desktop_app` | Desktop applications (Electron, native) | `streaming_audio`, `gaming` |

| `podcast` | Podcast feeds and episodes | `podcast` |
| `radio` | Radio station properties | `radio` |
| `streaming_audio` | Digital audio streaming properties | `streaming_audio` |

### Channels Without Property Types

The following channels do not have corresponding property types because they lack addressable, verifiable inventory surfaces in the traditional sense:

- `linear_tv` - Broadcast/cable inventory is managed through different authorization mechanisms
- `ooh` - Physical inventory lacks digital identifiers
- `print` - Physical publication inventory
- `cinema` - Theater inventory management systems
- `email` - Email list ownership differs from property authorization
- `influencer` - Creator relationships rather than property ownership
- `affiliate` - Performance-based partnerships, placements appear on partner websites
- `product_placement` - Content/event relationships rather than properties
- `retail_media` - Platform-managed inventory within retail ecosystems
- `search` - Platform-managed inventory
- `social` - Platform-managed inventory

```

## Implementation

### JSON Schema

Channels are defined in the AdCP schema at:

```
/schemas/v3/enums/channels.json
```

```json
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "$id": "/schemas/enums/channels.json",
  "title": "Media Channel",
  "description": "Standardized advertising media channels describing how buyers allocate budget",
  "type": "string",
  "enum": [
    "display",
    "olv",
    "social",
    "search",
    "ctv",
    "linear_tv",
    "radio",
    "streaming_audio",
    "podcast",
    "dooh",
    "ooh",
    "print",
    "cinema",
    "email",
    "gaming",
    "retail_media",
    "influencer",
    "affiliate",
    "product_placement"
  ]
}
```

### Usage in Product Discovery

When filtering products by channel:

```json
{
  "filters": {
    "channels": ["ctv", "olv", "streaming_audio"]
  }
}
```

### Usage in Property Definitions

Properties in `adagents.json` declare which channels they support:

```json
{
  "properties": [
    {
      "property_id": "youtube_app",
      "property_type": "ctv_app",
      "name": "YouTube CTV",
      "supported_channels": ["ctv", "olv", "social"],
      "identifiers": [
        {"type": "roku_store_id", "value": "12345"}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Usage in Product Definitions

Products declare which channels they are sold as. This typically inherits from properties but may be more specific:

```json
{
  "product_id": "youtube_ctv_premium",
  "name": "YouTube CTV Premium",
  "channels": ["ctv"],
  "publisher_properties": [
    {
      "publisher_domain": "youtube.com",
      "selection_type": "by_tag",
      "property_tags": ["ctv_apps"]
    }
  ]
}
```

Even though YouTube properties support `["olv", "social", "ctv"]`, this product is specifically sold as CTV inventory.

### Extensibility

Implementations MAY support additional channels beyond this specification using the `ext` field pattern:

```json
{
  "channel": "display",
  "ext": {
    "sub_channel": "native_content"
  }
}
```

## Versioning

This taxonomy follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):

- **MAJOR**: Removing channels, changing channel semantics
- **MINOR**: Adding new channels (append-only)
- **PATCH**: Clarifying descriptions, fixing typos

Adding new channels is a MINOR version change and MUST NOT break existing implementations.

## Migration from Legacy Channel Values

Prior to this taxonomy, AdCP used a different set of channel values. The following table maps legacy values to the new taxonomy:

| Legacy Value | New Channel(s) | Notes |
|--------------|----------------|-------|
| `display` | `display` | No change, but now excludes video |
| `video` | `olv`, `ctv` | Split by viewing environment |
| `audio` | `streaming_audio`, `podcast`, `radio` | Split by audio type |
| `native` | `display` | Native is a format, not a channel |
| `web` | `display`, `olv` | Web is a substrate, not a planning bucket |
| `mobile_app` | `display`, `olv`, `gaming` | App is a substrate, not a planning bucket |
| `dooh` | `dooh` | No change |
| `ctv` | `ctv` | No change |
| `podcast` | `podcast` | No change |
| `retail` | `retail_media` | Renamed |
| `commerce_media` | `retail_media` | Renamed |
| `social` | `social` | No change |
| `sponsorship` | `product_placement` | Renamed and refined |

### Migration Guidance

1. **Identify the planning context**: Determine HOW the buyer allocates budget, not where ads technically render.

2. **Split video by environment**: If video was a single category, split into `olv` (desktop/mobile) and `ctv` (TV screens).

3. **Remove substrate channels**: If you had `web` or `mobile_app` as channels, map to planning-oriented channels (`display`, `olv`) based on buying context.

4. **Update filters**: When filtering products, use the new channel values.

## Edge Cases and Ambiguities

### YouTube Classification

YouTube spans multiple channels depending on context:

| Scenario | Channel | Reasoning |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| YouTube video ad on phone/desktop | `olv` or `social` | Depends on buying approach |
| YouTube video ad on CTV | `ctv` | TV screen environment |
| YouTube Shorts | `social` | Short-form social context |
| YouTube Music | `streaming_audio` | Audio streaming context |

### Retail Media Complexity

Retail media may eventually warrant sub-channels:

| Scenario | Current | Potential Future |
|----------|---------|------------------|
| Sponsored products on Amazon | `retail_media` | `retail_media_search` |
| Display on retailer site | `retail_media` | `retail_media_display` |
| Off-site using retailer data | `retail_media` | `retail_media_offsite` |

With `channels` on products and `format_types` in filters, buyers can distinguish retail media product types (sponsored products vs display vs offsite) without sub-channels. Use `channels: ["retail_media"]` combined with format filters to narrow results. The two-axis approach (channel + format) is preferred over channel proliferation.

### Gaming vs Display/OLV

| Scenario | Channel | Reasoning |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| Rewarded video in mobile game via Unity Ads | `gaming` | Gaming-specific ad network |
| Banner in casual game via AdMob general pool | `display` | Standard mobile programmatic |
| Esports tournament sponsorship | `gaming` | Gaming audience context |

### Influencer vs Social

| Scenario | Channel | Reasoning |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| Buying promoted posts through Instagram Ads | `social` | Platform ad tools |
| Contracting an influencer directly | `influencer` | Creator partnership |
| Platform-inserted ads around creator content | `social` | Platform ad tools |

## Future Considerations

The following channels may be added in future versions based on market evolution:

- `messaging` - WhatsApp Business, Telegram ads
- `xr` - VR/AR advertising
- `ai_agents` - AI assistant and chatbot advertising
