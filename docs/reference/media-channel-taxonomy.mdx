# Media Channel Taxonomy

<Info>
**Status**: Draft Specification
**Version**: 1.0.0-draft
**Last Updated**: 2026-01-19
</Info>

This specification defines a standardized taxonomy for advertising media channels. It is designed for interoperability across media planning tools, ad tech platforms, and AI-powered advertising agents.

## Motivation

The advertising industry lacks a standardized channel taxonomy. While IAB Tech Lab provides taxonomies for content, audience, and ad products, no equivalent exists for media channels. This leads to:

- Inconsistent channel naming across platforms
- Difficulty aggregating cross-channel campaign data
- Confusion between channels, formats, and buying models
- Friction in automated media planning workflows

This specification addresses these gaps by defining:

1. **Media Channels** - Where advertising reaches audiences
2. **Property Types** - Addressable inventory surfaces with verifiable ownership
3. **Clear distinction** between channels, formats, and buying models

## Terminology

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119).

## Definitions

### Media Channel

A **media channel** describes WHERE advertising reaches people. It represents the distribution environment or medium through which ads are delivered to audiences.

Channels are defined by the **audience experience context**, not by:
- How the ad looks (that's a **format**)
- How inventory is purchased (that's a **buying model**)
- What technology serves the ad (that's **infrastructure**)

### Property Type

A **property type** describes a specific addressable inventory surface where:
- Ownership can be verified (e.g., via `adagents.json`)
- Ads can be programmatically served
- Identifiers exist for the property (domains, app IDs, device IDs)

Property types are a SUBSET of channels. Some channels (like `linear_tv` or `print`) may not have addressable property types in the digital sense.

### Format Category

A **format category** describes HOW an ad renders - its creative unit type. Examples: `video`, `audio`, `display`, `native`. Formats are orthogonal to channels; a video ad can appear across web, CTV, social, and mobile app channels.

### Buying Model

A **buying model** describes HOW inventory is purchased. Examples: programmatic auction, direct/guaranteed, influencer partnership, sponsorship. Buying models are orthogonal to channels.

## Media Channels

### Channel Enum

The following channels MUST be supported. Implementations MAY extend with additional channels using the `ext` field.

## Property Types

Property types describe addressable inventory surfaces with verifiable ownership. They are used in `adagents.json` for authorization validation.

### Property Type Enum

| Property Type | Description | Typical Channel(s) |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|

| `mobile_app` | Native mobile applications | `mobile_app`, `social`, `gaming` |

| `radio` | Radio station properties | `radio` |
| `streaming_audio` | Digital audio streaming properties | `streaming_audio` |

### Channels Without Property Types

The following channels do not have corresponding property types because they lack addressable, verifiable inventory surfaces in the traditional sense:

- `linear_tv` - Broadcast/cable inventory is managed through different authorization mechanisms
- `ooh` - Physical inventory lacks digital identifiers
- `print` - Physical publication inventory
- `cinema` - Theater inventory management systems
- `email` - Email list ownership differs from property authorization
- `influencer` - Creator relationships rather than property ownership
- `ai_agents` - Emerging channel, property model TBD
- `sponsorship` - Event/content relationships rather than properties
- `commerce_media` - Platform-managed inventory within retail/marketplace ecosystems
- `search` - Platform-managed inventory

## Implementation

### JSON Schema

Channels are defined in the AdCP schema at:

```
/schemas/v1/enums/channels.json
```

```json
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "$id": "/schemas/enums/channels.json",
  "title": "Media Channel",
  "description": "Standardized advertising media channels describing where ads reach audiences",
  "type": "string",
  "enum": [
    "web",
    "ctv",
    "mobile_app",
    "social",
    "search",
    "linear_tv",
    "radio",
    "streaming_audio",
    "podcast",
    "dooh",
    "ooh",
    "print",
    "cinema",
    "email",
    "gaming",
    "influencer",
    "ai_agents",
    "sponsorship",
    "commerce_media"
  ]
}
```

### Usage in Product Discovery

When filtering products by channel:

```json
{
  "filters": {
    "channels": ["ctv", "streaming_audio", "podcast"]
  }
}
```

### Usage in Property Definitions

Properties in `adagents.json` use `property_type`, not `channel`:

```json
{
  "properties": [
    {
      "property_id": "example_ctv",
      "property_type": "ctv_app",
      "name": "Example Streaming App",
      "identifiers": [
        {"type": "roku_store_id", "value": "12345"}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Extensibility

Implementations MAY support additional channels beyond this specification using the `ext` field pattern:

```json
{
  "channel": "web",
  "ext": {
    "sub_channel": "programmatic_guaranteed"
  }
}
```

## Versioning

This taxonomy follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):

- **MAJOR**: Removing channels, changing channel semantics
- **MINOR**: Adding new channels (append-only)
- **PATCH**: Clarifying descriptions, fixing typos

Adding new channels is a MINOR version change and MUST NOT break existing implementations.

## Migration from Legacy Channel Values

Prior to this taxonomy, AdCP used a different set of channel values that conflated channels with formats. The following table maps legacy values to the new taxonomy:

| Legacy Value | New Channel(s) | Notes |
|--------------|----------------|-------|
| `display` | `web`, `mobile_app`, `dooh` | Display is a **format**, not a channel. Map to the appropriate channel based on where the ad appears. |
| `video` | `web`, `ctv`, `mobile_app`, `social` | Video is a **format**. Map to the channel where video ads are delivered. |
| `audio` | `streaming_audio`, `podcast`, `radio` | Audio is a **format**. Map to the specific audio channel. |
| `native` | `web`, `mobile_app`, `social`, `commerce_media` | Native is a **format**. Map to the channel where native ads appear. |
| `dooh` | `dooh` | No change. |
| `ctv` | `ctv` | No change. |
| `podcast` | `podcast` | No change. |
| `retail` | `commerce_media` | Renamed to encompass retail media networks, marketplaces, and transactional platforms. |
| `social` | `social` | No change. |

### Migration Guidance

1. **Identify the delivery context**: Determine WHERE the ad reaches the audience, not what format it uses.

2. **Separate channel from format**: If your system stored `video` as a channel, you likely need to track both the channel (`web`, `ctv`, etc.) AND the format (`video`) separately.

3. **Update filters**: When filtering products, use the new channel values. For format filtering, use the `format_types` field instead.

4. **Review integrations**: Any systems passing channel values to AdCP APIs will need to be updated to use the new taxonomy.
