# Authentication Specification

AdCP uses a tiered authentication model where some operations are publicly accessible while others require authentication.

## When Authentication is Required

### Public Operations (No Authentication Required)

These operations work without credentials to enable discovery and evaluation:

- **`list_creative_formats`** - Browse available creative formats
- **`list_authorized_properties`** - See which properties an agent represents
- **`get_products`** - Discover inventory (returns limited results without auth)

**Rationale**: Publishers want potential buyers to discover their capabilities before establishing a business relationship.

**Important**: Unauthenticated `get_products` may return:
- Partial catalog (run-of-network products only)
- No pricing information or CPM details
- No custom product offerings
- Generic format support only

### Authenticated Operations (Credentials Required)

These operations require valid credentials:

- **`get_products`** (full access) - Complete catalog with pricing and custom products
- **`create_media_buy`** - Create advertising campaigns
- **`update_media_buy`** - Modify existing campaigns
- **`sync_creatives`** - Upload creative assets
- **`list_creatives`** - View your creative library
- **`get_media_buy_delivery`** - Monitor campaign performance and metrics
- **`provide_performance_feedback`** - Submit optimization signals

**Rationale**: These operations involve financial commitments, access to proprietary data, or modifications to active campaigns.

## Authentication Methods

AdCP supports multiple authentication methods. Implementations must support at least one method:

### JWT Bearer Token
```http
Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>
```

JWT tokens must include standard claims:
```json
{
  "sub": "principal_123",
  "exp": 1706745600,
  "iat": 1706742000,
  "permissions": {
    "products": ["read"],
    "media_buys": ["read", "write"],
    "creatives": ["read", "write"],
    "reports": ["read"]
  }
}
```

### API Key
```http
X-API-Key: <api_key>
```

API keys are mapped to principals and their associated permissions.

## Principal Model

```typescript
interface Principal {
  principal_id: string;
  permissions: {
    products: Permission[];
    media_buys: Permission[];
    creatives: Permission[];
    reports: Permission[];
  };
}

type Permission = 'read' | 'write' | 'delete' | 'approve';
```

## Required Headers by Protocol

### MCP
```json
{
  "headers": {
    "Authorization": "Bearer <token>"
  }
}
```

### A2A
```json
{
  "headers": {
    "Authorization": "Bearer <token>"
  }
}
```

### HTTP REST
```http
Authorization: Bearer <token>
# OR
X-API-Key: <api_key>
```

## Obtaining Credentials

### Account Setup Process

To access authenticated operations, you must establish an account with each sales agent:

1. **Identify Sales Agents**: Discover sales agents via publisher `adagents.json` files
2. **Contact Sales Team**: Reach out to the agent's sales or partnerships team
3. **Complete Onboarding**: Provide business information, sign agreements, configure billing
4. **Receive Credentials**: Get API keys or OAuth client credentials

**Note**: Each sales agent manages their own accounts independently. You need separate credentials for each agent you work with.

### Dynamic Registration (Optional)

Some sales agents support OAuth 2.0 dynamic client registration:

```http
POST /oauth/register
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "client_name": "Your Company Name",
  "redirect_uris": ["https://yourapp.com/callback"],
  "grant_types": ["authorization_code", "refresh_token"],
  "scope": "adcp:products adcp:media_buys adcp:creatives"
}
```

Check the sales agent's documentation or `adagents.json` for dynamic registration support.

### Aggregation Platforms

Consider using aggregation platforms (like Scope3) that manage credentials and relationships with multiple sales agents on your behalf. This simplifies:
- Credential management
- Financial relationships
- Legal agreements
- Compliance monitoring

## Error Responses

### Unauthenticated Request to Protected Operation

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "AUTH_REQUIRED",
    "message": "Authentication required for this operation"
  }
}
```

### Invalid or Expired Credentials

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "AUTH_INVALID",
    "message": "Invalid or expired credentials"
  }
}
```

### Insufficient Permissions

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "INSUFFICIENT_PERMISSIONS",
    "message": "Principal does not have required permissions for this operation"
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Secure Storage**: Store credentials securely (environment variables, secret managers)
2. **Rotation**: Implement credential rotation policies
3. **Scope Limitation**: Request minimum required permissions
4. **Token Refresh**: Implement automatic token refresh for JWT tokens
5. **Error Handling**: Handle authentication errors gracefully with retry logic

## Testing Authentication

Use dry run mode to test authenticated operations without affecting production:

```http
X-Dry-Run: true
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

See [Testing & Development Guide](/docs/media-buy/advanced-topics/testing) for complete testing capabilities.
