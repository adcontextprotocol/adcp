## A

**Account**
A billing relationship between a buyer and a seller. The account determines rate cards, payment terms, and billing entity. An agent may have access to multiple accounts (e.g., an agency managing accounts for different clients). See [Accounts and Agents](/docs/building/integration/accounts-and-agents).

**Account Type**
Classification of MCP session credentials as either "platform" (aggregator) or "customer" (direct advertiser/agency).

**Activation**
The process of making a signal available for targeting on a specific platform and seat.

**Ad Context Protocol (AdCP)**
An open standard for AI-powered advertising workflows. AdCP defines domain-specific tasks and schemas that work over MCP and A2A as transports, enabling natural language interfaces for advertising operations.

**Agentic Commerce Protocol (ACP)**
An open standard developed by OpenAI and Stripe for programmatic commerce flows in AI assistants. ACP defines how agents can initiate checkout, delegate payment, and complete transactions without becoming the merchant of record. In the context of Sponsored Intelligence, ACP handles the transaction after a brand agent hands off a user with purchase intent.

**Agentic eXecution Engine (AXE)**
The real-time execution layer that sits between orchestrators and decisioning platforms, handling dynamic audience targeting, brand safety enforcement, frequency management, and first-party data activation at impression time. See [AXE documentation](/docs/media-buy/advanced-topics/agentic-execution-engine) for details.

**AgenticAdvertising.org**
The member organization that stewards the Ad Context Protocol (AdCP) and related open standards for AI-powered advertising.

**Agent** (AdCP Context)
The authenticated entity making API calls—may be a brand's internal team, an agency's trading desk, or an automated buying system. Identified by the authentication token. Distinct from "Sales Agent" (the MCP server exposing inventory) and "AI Agent" (the AI assistant). See [Accounts and Agents](/docs/building/integration/accounts-and-agents).
