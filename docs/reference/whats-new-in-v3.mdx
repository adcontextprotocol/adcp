---

## New capabilities

### Brand Protocol

Buy-side identity through `/.well-known/brand.json`. Just as publishers use `adagents.json` to declare properties and authorized agents, brands use `brand.json` to declare their identity, brand hierarchy, and authorized operators.

| Sell side | Buy side |
|-----------|----------|
| Publisher | **House** (corporate entity) |
| Property | **Brand** (advertising identity) |
| `adagents.json` | **`brand.json`** |

Four variants: **House Portfolio** (full brand hierarchy inline), **Brand Agent** (dynamic via MCP), **House Redirect** (sub-brand to house domain), and **Authoritative Location** (hosted URL).

Given any domain, the protocol resolves to a canonical brand:

```
shoes.novabrands.example.com
  -> fetch /.well-known/brand.json
  -> { "house": "novabrands.example.com" }
  -> fetch novabrands.example.com/.well-known/brand.json
  -> search brands[] for property matching "shoes.novabrands.example.com"
  -> Result: { house: "novabrands.example.com", brand_id: "nova_athletics" }
```

**Use cases:** creative generation (resolve domain to brand manifest), brand verification (check `authorized_operators`), reporting roll-up (group campaigns by house).

### Registry API

The AgenticAdvertising.org registry provides a public REST API for resolving brands and properties, discovering agents, and validating authorization. Most endpoints require no authentication.

| Capability | Endpoint | Description |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| Brand resolution | `/api/brands/resolve` | Resolve domain to canonical brand |
| Property resolution | `/api/properties/resolve` | Resolve publisher domain to property info |
| Agent discovery | `/api/registry/agents` | List registered agents with capabilities |
| Authorization check | `/api/registry/validate/property-authorization` | Real-time authorization validation |
| Search | `/api/search` | Search across brands, publishers, and properties |
| Community brands | `/api/brands/save` | Contribute brand data (auth required) |

The registry complements the protocol: resolve entities via the REST API, then transact via MCP/A2A tasks.

### Proposals and delivery forecasts

Publishers can return **proposals** alongside products — structured media plans with percentage-based budget allocations that buyers can execute directly via `create_media_buy`. Proposals encode publisher expertise, replacing ad-hoc product lists with actionable buying strategies. They can be refined through session continuity — subsequent `get_products` calls within the same session carry conversation history.

**Delivery forecasts** attach to proposals and allocations. Each forecast contains budget points with metric ranges (low/mid/high), showing how delivery scales with spend. Three forecast methods: **`estimate`** (rough approximation), **`modeled`** (predictive models), **`guaranteed`** (contractually committed). Forecasts can predict delivery metrics (impressions, reach, GRPs) and outcomes (purchases, leads, app installs). TV and radio forecasts use `demographic_system` and `demographic` for GRP-based planning.

---

### Accounts

Formal billing relationships between buyers and sellers via `sync_accounts`.

**Four entities:**

| Entity | Question | How identified |
|--------|----------|----------------|
| **Brand** | Whose products are advertised? | House domain + brand_id via `brand.json` |
| **Account** | Who gets billed? | `account_id` from `sync_accounts` |
| **Operator** | Who operates the seat? | Domain (e.g., `acmeagency.example.com`) |
| **Agent** | What software places buys? | Authenticated session |

**Three billing models:** `brand` (brand invoiced directly), `operator` (agency invoiced), `agent` (agent consolidates billing). **Two trust models:** agent-trusted (default, agent declares brands/operators) and operator-scoped (seller requires operator-level credentials).

**Workflow:** `get_adcp_capabilities` -> `sync_accounts` -> `get_products` with `account_id` -> `create_media_buy` with `account_id`.

---

### Capability discovery

`get_adcp_capabilities` replaces static agent card extensions with runtime capability discovery. It returns supported protocols, account billing models, portfolio information, targeting systems, and governance features — all schema-validated.

| Agent card extension | get_adcp_capabilities |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| Static JSON file | Runtime discovery |
| Single file location | Works with any transport |
| Limited schema | Rich capability declaration |
| No validation | Schema-validated responses |

  Full task reference with request/response schemas.
</Card>

---

### Governance Protocol

Brand suitability and inventory curation. Governance agents manage **property lists** (curated sets of properties for targeting or exclusion) and **content standards** (brand suitability policies with per-category block/allow rules). Buyers pass property lists to `get_products` for filtered inventory discovery, and use `calibrate_content` for collaborative alignment between brand and governance agent.

  Full specification including property lists, content standards, and calibration.
</Card>

---

### Sponsored Intelligence Protocol

Conversational brand experiences in AI assistants. SI defines how AI assistants invoke brand agents for rich engagement (text, voice, UI components) without breaking the conversational flow. Sessions follow a consent-first model: user expresses interest, grants consent, then the brand agent engages conversationally with optional transaction handoff.

### Signal catalogs for data providers

Data providers can publish signal catalogs via `adagents.json`, following the same pattern as publishers declaring properties.

| Publishers | Data providers |
|------------|----------------|
| Declare **properties** | Declare **signals** |
| Use `property_ids` / `property_tags` | Use `signal_ids` / `signal_tags` |
| Buyers verify via `publisher_domain` | Buyers verify via `data_provider_domain` |

Signals now have explicit `value_type` (binary, categorical, numeric) with typed targeting, and structured `signal_id` objects that reference the data provider's catalog.

## Breaking changes

### Media channel taxonomy

v2's 9 channels are replaced by 19 planning-oriented channels. Five channels carried over unchanged (`display`, `social`, `ctv`, `podcast`, `dooh`). The remaining four are split, removed, or renamed.

<Warning>
All code that reads or writes channel values must be updated.
</Warning>

| v2 channel | v3 channel(s) | Notes |
|------------|---------------|-------|
| `display` | `display` | Unchanged |
| `video` | `olv`, `linear_tv`, `cinema` | Split by distribution context (`ctv` was already separate in v2) |
| `audio` | `radio`, `streaming_audio` | Split by distribution (`podcast` was already separate in v2) |
| `native` | Removed | Use format-level properties instead |
| `social` | `social` | Unchanged |
| `ctv` | `ctv` | Unchanged |
| `podcast` | `podcast` | Unchanged |
| `dooh` | `dooh` | Unchanged |
| `retail` | `retail_media` | Renamed for clarity |

New channels in v3 (no v2 equivalent): `search`, `linear_tv`, `radio`, `streaming_audio`, `ooh`, `print`, `cinema`, `email`, `gaming`, `retail_media`, `influencer`, `affiliate`, `product_placement`.

<Note>
The `gaming` channel covers intrinsic in-game ads, rewarded video, and playable ads. Rewarded video in gaming apps could also be classified as `olv` — use `gaming` when the inventory comes from a gaming budget.

### Pricing option field renames

v3 separates **hard constraints** (publisher-enforced prices) from **soft hints** (historical percentiles). `fixed_rate` becomes `fixed_price`, and `price_guidance.floor` moves to top-level `floor_price`.

| v2 field | v3 field | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| `fixed_rate` | `fixed_price` | Renamed for clarity (it's a price, not a rate) |
| `price_guidance.floor` | `floor_price` | Moved to top level as hard constraint |

These fields map to standard deal types: `fixed_price` corresponds to Programmatic Guaranteed (PG) and Preferred Deals, while `floor_price` corresponds to Private Marketplace (PMP) auctions. Open auction inventory omits both fields.

<Card title="Pricing deep dive" icon="arrow-right" href="/docs/reference/migration/pricing">
  Fixed-price vs auction examples, price guidance schema, flat-rate pricing, minimum spend, and transition period handling.
</Card>

---

### Creative assignments with weighting

`creative_ids` string arrays are replaced by `creative_assignments` objects that support delivery weighting and placement targeting.

| v2 field | v3 field |
|----------|----------|
| `creative_ids` (string array) | `creative_assignments` (object array with `creative_id`, `weight`, `placement_ids`) |

<Card title="Creatives deep dive" icon="arrow-right" href="/docs/reference/migration/creatives">
  Weighted assignments, placement targeting, asset discovery with the unified `assets` array, repeatable groups, and format cards.
</Card>

---

### Geo targeting with named systems

Metro and postal targeting now require explicit system specification, supporting global markets. Values are grouped by system using `{ "system": "...", "values": [...] }` objects.

| v2 field | v3 field |
|----------|----------|
| `geo_metros` (string array) | `geo_metros` (system/values objects) |
| `geo_postal_codes` (string array) | `geo_postal_areas` (system/values objects) |

v3 also adds `geo_metros_exclude` and `geo_postal_areas_exclude` for negative targeting (e.g., target the US except the New York DMA).

<Card title="Geo targeting deep dive" icon="arrow-right" href="/docs/reference/migration/geo-targeting">
  Metro and postal system reference tables, exclusion targeting, capability discovery, and a full targeting example.
</Card>

---

### Other targeting changes

v3 adds several targeting fields beyond geo:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `daypart_targets` | Time-of-day and day-of-week targeting windows |
| `age_restriction` | Age-gating for restricted content |
| `device_platform` | Device type targeting (desktop, mobile, tablet, ctv) |
| `language` | Content language targeting |

These fields are optional additions — they don't replace any v2 fields.

---

### Unified asset discovery

Formats now use an `assets` array with `required` boolean instead of `assets_required`. See the [creatives deep dive](/docs/reference/migration/creatives#asset-discovery).

---

### Privacy and consent

AdCP does not define its own consent framework. Privacy signals (TCF 2.0, GPP, US Privacy String) should be passed via the brief's `ext` field or through transport-level headers. Sellers that require consent signals should declare this in `get_adcp_capabilities` using the extension mechanism.

---

## Removed in v3

| Removed | Replacement |
|---------|-------------|
| `adcp-extension.json` agent card | `get_adcp_capabilities` task |
| `list_authorized_properties` task | `get_adcp_capabilities` portfolio section |
| `assets_required` in formats | `assets` array with `required` boolean |
| `preview_image` in formats | `format_card` object |
| `creative_ids` in packages | `creative_assignments` array |
| `geo_postal_codes` | `geo_postal_areas` |
| `fixed_rate` in pricing | `fixed_price` |
| `price_guidance.floor` | `floor_price` (top-level) |
