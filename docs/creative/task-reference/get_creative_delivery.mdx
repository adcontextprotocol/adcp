title: get_creative_delivery
---


Retrieve creative delivery data from a creative agent, including variant-level breakdowns with manifests and metrics. This task returns what variants were created from your creatives, what they looked like (via manifests), and how they performed.

**Request Schema**: [`/schemas/v2/creative/get-creative-delivery-request.json`](https://adcontextprotocol.org/schemas/v2/creative/get-creative-delivery-request.json)
**Response Schema**: [`/schemas/v2/creative/get-creative-delivery-response.json`](https://adcontextprotocol.org/schemas/v2/creative/get-creative-delivery-response.json)

## Request Parameters

At least one scoping filter (`media_buy_ids`, `media_buy_buyer_refs`, or `creative_ids`) should be provided.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `account_id` | string | No | Account context for routing and scoping. Limits results to creatives within this account. |
| `media_buy_ids` | string[] | No | Filter to specific media buys by publisher ID |
| `media_buy_buyer_refs` | string[] | No | Filter to specific media buys by buyer reference ID |
| `creative_ids` | string[] | No | Filter to specific creatives by ID |
| `start_date` | string | No | Start date for delivery period (YYYY-MM-DD, interpreted in the platform's reporting timezone) |
| `end_date` | string | No | End date for delivery period (YYYY-MM-DD, interpreted in the platform's reporting timezone) |
| `max_variants` | integer | No | Maximum variants to return per creative. Useful for generative creatives with large variant counts. |

## Response

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `account_id` | Account identifier (present when scoped to a specific account) |
| `media_buy_id` | Publisher's media buy identifier (present when request was scoped to a single buy) |
| `media_buy_buyer_ref` | Buyer's reference for the media buy — echoed back so the buyer can correlate without mapping publisher IDs |
| `currency` | ISO 4217 currency code for monetary values (e.g., 'USD', 'EUR') |
| `reporting_period` | Date range with start/end timestamps and `timezone` (IANA identifier — platforms report in their native timezone) |
| `creatives` | Array of creative delivery data with variant breakdowns |

### Creative Object

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `creative_id` | Creative identifier |
| `media_buy_id` | Publisher's media buy identifier (present when the request spanned multiple media buys) |
| `format_id` | Format of this creative |
| `totals` | Aggregate delivery metrics across all variants |
| `variant_count` | Total number of variants (may exceed `variants` array length when `max_variants` is used) |
| `variants` | Array of variant-level delivery data (empty if creative has no variants yet) |

### Variant Object

Each variant represents a specific execution: a fixed creative (Tier 1), an asset combination the platform selected (Tier 2), or a generated variant (Tier 3).

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `variant_id` | Platform-assigned variant identifier |
| `manifest` | (Optional) The rendered creative manifest — the actual output that was served, not the input assets. Contains format_id and resolved assets. Not all platforms can provide manifests for every variant. |
| `generation_context` | (Optional, Tier 3) Input signals that triggered generation — e.g., page topic, conversation theme, query category. Platforms provide summarized/anonymized signals, not raw user input. |
| Standard metrics | All delivery metrics (impressions, spend, clicks, ctr, etc.) |

Derived metrics like `ctr`, `completion_rate`, `roas`, and `cost_per_click` are platform-calculated and may not equal naive division of their component fields due to rounding, attribution windows, or filtered impressions.

## Tier Behavior

### Tier 1: Standard Creatives

One creative maps 1:1 to one variant. The variant metrics match the creative totals.

```json
{
  "media_buy_id": "mb_12345",
  "currency": "USD",
  "reporting_period": {
    "start": "2026-01-20T00:00:00-05:00",
    "end": "2026-01-27T23:59:59-05:00",
    "timezone": "America/New_York"
  },
  "creatives": [
    {
      "creative_id": "hero_video_30s",
      "totals": {
        "impressions": 150000,
        "spend": 7500,
        "clicks": 4500,
        "ctr": 0.03,
        "completion_rate": 0.72
      },
      "variants": [
        {
          "variant_id": "hero_video_30s",
          "impressions": 150000,
          "spend": 7500,
          "clicks": 4500,
          "ctr": 0.03,
          "completion_rate": 0.72
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Tier 2: Asset Group Optimization

Buyer provides multiple asset alternatives using a format with `selection_mode: "optimize"`. Platform tests combinations and returns the manifest for each variant showing which assets were selected.

```json
{
  "media_buy_id": "mb_12345",
  "currency": "USD",
  "reporting_period": {
    "start": "2026-01-20T00:00:00-05:00",
    "end": "2026-01-27T23:59:59-05:00",
    "timezone": "America/New_York"
  },
  "creatives": [
    {
      "creative_id": "summer_campaign_assets",
      "totals": {
        "impressions": 200000,
        "spend": 10000,
        "clicks": 8000,
        "ctr": 0.04
      },
      "variants": [

          "manifest": {
            "format_id": {
              "agent_url": "https://creative.example.com",
              "id": "display_300x250"
            },
            "assets": {
              "headline_0_text": {
                "asset_type": "text",
                "content": "Summer Sale - 50% Off"
              },
              "image_0_url": {
                "asset_type": "image",
                "url": "https://cdn.brand.com/beach_hero.jpg",
                "width": 300,
                "height": 250
              }
            }
          },
          "impressions": 120000,
          "spend": 6000,
          "clicks": 6000,
          "ctr": 0.05
        },
        {
          "variant_id": "var_headline_b_image_d",
          "manifest": {
            "format_id": {
              "agent_url": "https://creative.example.com",
              "id": "display_300x250"
            },
            "assets": {
              "headline_0_text": {
                "asset_type": "text",
                "content": "Shop Summer Styles"
              },
              "image_0_url": {
                "asset_type": "image",
                "url": "https://cdn.brand.com/sunset_hero.jpg",
                "width": 300,
                "height": 250
              }
            }
          },
          "impressions": 80000,
          "spend": 4000,
          "clicks": 2000,
          "ctr": 0.025
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Tier 3: Generative Creative

Platform generates variants from brand manifest and input contexts. The `manifest` contains the generated assets — which may differ entirely from what the buyer submitted.

```json
{
  "media_buy_id": "mb_12345",
  "currency": "USD",
  "reporting_period": {
    "start": "2026-01-20T00:00:00-05:00",
    "end": "2026-01-27T23:59:59-05:00",
    "timezone": "America/New_York"
  },
  "creatives": [
    {
      "creative_id": "generative_banner",
      "totals": {
        "impressions": 300000,
        "spend": 15000,
        "clicks": 12000,

                "url": "https://cdn.creative.example.com/generated/mobile_morning_v1.jpg",
                "width": 300,
                "height": 250
              },
              "headline": {
                "asset_type": "text",
                "content": "Start Your Summer Right"
              }
            }
          },
          "impressions": 180000,
          "spend": 9000,
          "clicks": 9000,
          "ctr": 0.05
        },
        {
          "variant_id": "gen_desktop_evening",
          "generation_context": {
            "context_type": "web_page",
            "topic": "lifestyle, evening entertainment",
            "device_class": "desktop"
          },
          "manifest": {
            "format_id": {
              "agent_url": "https://creative.example.com",
              "id": "display_728x90_generative"
            },
            "assets": {
              "hero_image": {
                "asset_type": "image",
                "url": "https://cdn.creative.example.com/generated/desktop_evening_v1.jpg",
                "width": 728,
                "height": 90
              },
              "headline": {
                "asset_type": "text",
                "content": "Evening Deals Await"
              }
            }
          },
          "impressions": 120000,
          "spend": 6000,
          "clicks": 3000,
          "ctr": 0.025
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Previewing Variants

Use `preview_creative` with `request_type: "variant"` to see what a specific variant looked like when served:

```json
{
  "request_type": "variant",
  "variant_id": "gen_mobile_morning"
}
```

Since each variant includes its full `manifest`, you can also pass the manifest directly to `preview_creative` as a standard single request to re-render it.

## Relationship to Delivery Reporting

| Data Source | Task | What It Provides |
|---|---|---|
| Sales agent | `get_media_buy_delivery` | WHERE and HOW MUCH: impressions, spend, placement data, optional `by_creative` breakdown |
| Creative agent | `get_creative_delivery` | WHAT RAN and HOW: variant manifests and variant-level metrics |

Use `media_buy_id` + `creative_id` as join keys to correlate data across both sources.

## Creative Agent Capability

Creative agents that support this task declare `"delivery"` in their capabilities:

```json
{
  "capabilities": ["validation", "assembly", "preview", "delivery"]
}
```
