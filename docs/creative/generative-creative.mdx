title: Generative Creative
---

The Creative Protocol enables AI-powered creative generation and asset management for advertising campaigns. This guide will help you create your first creative in 5 minutes.

> **Technical Reference**: This guide shows how to use the [`build_creative` task](/docs/creative/task-reference/build_creative). For complete API specifications, see the task reference documentation.

## Overview

The Creative Protocol provides AI-powered creative generation:

- **`build_creative`**: Generate creative content using AI with either static manifests or dynamic code
- **`preview_creative`**: Generate previews of creative manifests
- **`list_creative_formats`**: Discover supported creative formats

Assets are provided via [brand identity](/docs/brand-protocol/brand-json) - no separate asset library management needed.

## Quick Start: Generate Your First Creative

### Step 1: Basic Creative Generation

Here's the simplest possible request to generate a native display ad:

```json
{
  "message": "Create a simple ad for a coffee shop promotion - 20% off all drinks this week",
  "format_id": {
    "agent_url": "https://creative.adcontextprotocol.org",
    "id": "display_native"
  },
  "output_mode": "manifest"
}
```

### Step 2: Understanding the Response

You'll receive a structured creative manifest:

```json
{
  "creative_manifest": {
    "format_id": {
      "agent_url": "https://creative.adcontextprotocol.org",
      "id": "display_native"
    },
    "assets": {
      "headline": {
        "content": "20% Off All Drinks This Week!"
      },
      "description": {
        "content": "Visit our cozy coffee shop and enjoy premium coffee at an unbeatable price."
      },
      "call_to_action": {
        "content": "Visit Today"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Refine Your Creative

Iterate by passing the previous output back with a new `message`. You can send the full manifest (stateless) or reference a `generated_creative_ref` from the previous response (stateful):

**Stateless** — pass the manifest back:

```json
{
  "message": "Make the headline more exciting and add urgency",
  "target_format_id": {
    "agent_url": "https://creative.adcontextprotocol.org",
    "id": "display_native"
  },
  "creative_manifest": {
    "format_id": {
      "agent_url": "https://creative.adcontextprotocol.org",
      "id": "display_native"
    },
    "assets": {
      "headline": {
        "content": "20% Off All Drinks This Week!"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Stateful** — reference by `generated_creative_ref` (when the previous response included one):

```json
{
  "message": "Make the headline more exciting and add urgency",
  "generated_creative_ref": "gcr_coffee_001",
  "target_format_id": {
    "agent_url": "https://creative.adcontextprotocol.org",
    "id": "display_native"
  }
}
```

## Common Patterns

### Using brand identity

Provide brand context for better creative generation:

```json
{
  "message": "Create a display ad for our coffee shop promotion",
  "format_id": {
    "agent_url": "https://creative.adcontextprotocol.org",
    "id": "display_300x250"
  },
  "brand": {
    "domain": "mycoffeeshop.com"
  },
  "output_mode": "manifest"
}
```

**Minimal brand reference**: Start with just a domain for low-friction creative generation:

```json
{
  "message": "Create a coffee shop ad",
  "format_id": {
    "agent_url": "https://creative.adcontextprotocol.org",
    "id": "display_native"
  },
  "brand": {
    "domain": "mycoffeeshop.com"
  }
}
```

See [brand.json reference](/docs/brand-protocol/brand-json) for comprehensive examples.

### Using Your Own Assets

Provide existing assets to incorporate into the creative:

```json
{
  "message": "Create a display ad featuring our signature latte",
  "target_format_id": {
    "agent_url": "https://creative.adcontextprotocol.org",
    "id": "display_300x250"
  },
  "creative_manifest": {
    "format_id": {
      "agent_url": "https://creative.adcontextprotocol.org",
      "id": "display_300x250"
    },
    "assets": {
      "brand_logo": {
        "url": "https://mycoffeeshop.com/assets/logo.png",
        "width": 200,
        "height": 50
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Generating Dynamic Code

For real-time personalization, use code mode:

```json
{
  "message": "Create a weather-responsive coffee ad that shows hot drinks when cold, iced drinks when warm",
  "format_id": {
    "agent_url": "https://creative.adcontextprotocol.org",
    "id": "display_native"
  },
  "output_mode": "code"
}
```

## Format Discovery

### Standard Formats

Common format IDs you can use immediately:
- `display_native` - Native advertising format
- `display_300x250` - Medium rectangle banner
- `video_standard_30s` - 30-second video ad

### Publisher-Specific Formats

For custom publisher formats, specify the source:

```json
{
  "message": "Create a premium video ad",
  "format_id": {
    "agent_url": "https://premium-publisher.com",
    "id": "premium_video_15s"
  },
  "output_mode": "manifest"
}
```

## Common Issues

### Format Not Found
If you get a format error, the publisher may not support that format. Try:
1. Use a standard AdCP format first (`display_native`, `video_standard_30s`)
2. Check the publisher's `list_creative_formats` endpoint
3. Verify the `format_source` URL is correct

### Creative Quality Issues
To improve creative output:
1. Be more specific in your message: "Create a minimalist coffee ad with earth tones"
2. Provide comprehensive brand identity with assets and guidelines
3. Iterate using [refinement](/docs/creative/task-reference/build_creative#iterative-refinement) — pass back the manifest or `generated_creative_ref` with a new message

### Asset Management
Assets are provided via [brand identity](/docs/brand-protocol/brand-json):
1. Include assets in brand identity with descriptive tags
2. Use `asset_filters` in requests to select specific assets
3. Reference product catalogs for large inventories
