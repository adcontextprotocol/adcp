# Creative Protocol Overview

This guide explains how creatives work in AdCP, from defining format requirements to assembling and delivering ads.

## The Four Key Concepts

### 1. **Assets**
The individual building blocks: images, videos, text, HTML, JavaScript, tracking URLs.

**Example**: A product image, a headline, a 30-second video file, a VAST tag.

### 2. **Formats**
Specifications that define what assets are required and how they should be assembled.

**Example**: "video_30s" format requires a 30-second MP4 video file with specific dimensions and codec.

### 3. **Manifests**
Packages that provide the actual assets to fulfill a format's requirements.

**Example**: A manifest for "video_30s" provides the URL to your actual 30-second video file, plus tracking pixels and landing page URL.

### 4. **Creative Agents**
Services that:
- Define and document formats (authoritative source)
- Explain how to render each format
- Validate manifests against format requirements
- Generate previews showing how creatives will look
- Optionally: build manifests from natural language briefs

## How They Fit Together

```
Format Definition (by Creative Agent)
  ↓
  "video_30s format requires:
   - One video file asset (MP4, 30s, 1920x1080)
   - One clickthrough URL"

Creative Manifest (by Buyer)
  ↓
  "Here's my actual video file:
   https://cdn.brand.com/spring_30s.mp4
   Landing page: https://brand.com/spring-sale"

Sales Agent (validates & delivers)
  ↓
  - Checks: Is this really 30 seconds? Is it MP4?
  - Adds: Impression tracking, click tracking
  - Delivers: Creative to ad server
```

## The Workflow

### 1. **Discovery** - "What formats do you support?"

Buyers call `list_creative_formats` on sales or creative agents to discover available formats with full specifications. The `agent_url` field identifies the creative agent authoritative for each format.

See [Creative Formats](/docs/creative/formats) for format discovery details.

### 2. **Assembly** - "Here are my assets"

Buyers create manifests providing assets that fulfill format requirements. Manifests pair format specifications with actual asset URLs and content.

See [Creative Manifests](/docs/creative/creative-manifests) for manifest structure details.

### 3. **Validation** - "Does this match the requirements?"

Creative agents validate manifests:
- Are all required assets provided?
- Do they meet technical specs (duration, dimensions, file size)?
- Are tracking macros formatted correctly?

### 4. **Delivery** - "Traffic this to the ad server"

Sales agents deliver validated creatives to their ad servers, translating AdCP universal concepts to platform-specific formats.

## Core Concepts

### Assets & Asset Types
Assets are the raw materials. Each has a type that determines its purpose:
- **image**: Static images (JPEG, PNG, WebP)
- **video**: Video files (MP4, WebM) or VAST tags
- **audio**: Audio files (MP3, M4A) or DAAST tags
- **text**: Headlines, descriptions, CTAs
- **html**: HTML5 creatives or third-party tags
- **javascript**: JavaScript tags
- **url**: Tracking pixels, clickthrough URLs, webhooks

See [Asset Types](/docs/creative/asset-types) for detailed specifications.

### Formats & Format Authority
Each format has an authoritative source - the creative agent that defines it (indicated by `agent_url`). That agent:
- Hosts the definitive documentation
- Explains how to assemble assets
- Describes how the format renders
- Provides validation rules

**Standard vs. Custom Formats:**
- **Standard formats** are hosted by the reference creative agent (`https://creative.adcontextprotocol.org`) and based on IAB specifications
- **Custom formats** are defined by individual publishers or creative platforms for specialized inventory
- Technically, both work the same way - the `agent_url` field identifies which agent is authoritative for each format

See the [Channel Guides](/docs/creative/channels/video) for format examples and patterns across video, display, audio, DOOH, and carousels.

### Manifests
Manifests are JSON structures pairing asset IDs from the format with actual asset content. They provide the URLs, text, and tracking pixels needed to assemble a complete creative.

See [Creative Manifests](/docs/creative/creative-manifests) for detailed documentation.

### Universal Macros
Macros are placeholders in tracking URLs that get replaced with actual values at impression time (e.g., `{MEDIA_BUY_ID}`, `{DEVICE_ID}`, `{CACHEBUSTER}`). AdCP defines universal macros that work across all platforms - sales agents translate them to their ad server's syntax.

See [Universal Macros](/docs/creative/universal-macros) for complete reference.

## Common Patterns

### Third-Party Tags
For third-party served ads, formats specify HTML or JavaScript asset requirements. See the [Display Channel Guide](/docs/creative/channels/display) for third-party tag format examples.

### Repeatable Asset Groups
For carousels, slideshows, stories, playlists - anything with multiple repetitions of the same structure. See the [Carousel & Multi-Asset Formats](/docs/creative/channels/carousels) guide for complete documentation on repeatable asset groups.

### DOOH Impression Tracking
Digital Out-of-Home formats use impression tracking with venue-specific macros instead of device identifiers. See the [DOOH Channel Guide](/docs/creative/channels/dooh) for DOOH-specific macro details.

## Channel-Specific Information

For detailed information on specific ad formats and channels, see the [Creative Manifests](/docs/creative/creative-manifests) documentation which covers:

- **Video Ads** - VAST, hosted video, CTV formats
- **Display Ads** - Banners, third-party tags, responsive formats
- **Audio Ads** - Streaming audio formats
- **DOOH** - Digital billboards, venue targeting, venue-based impression tracking
- **Repeatable Asset Groups** - Carousels, slideshows, story formats

## Getting Started

1. **Discover formats**: Call `list_creative_formats` to see what's available
2. **Choose your channel guide**: Pick the guide that matches your campaign type
3. **Build your manifest**: Follow the format requirements
4. **Use universal macros**: Add tracking with standardized macros
5. **Preview**: Use `preview_creative` to see how it looks
6. **Submit**: Include manifests in your `create_media_buy` request
