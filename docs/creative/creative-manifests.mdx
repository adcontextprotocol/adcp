title: Creative Manifests
---


Creative manifests define a creative preset: a reusable configuration of brand content that can be instantiated in a specific creative format.

A manifest does not define structure, layout, or rendering behavior. Instead, it supplies concrete asset values that satisfy the requirements defined by a creative format. When combined with a format definition, a manifest produces a renderable creative instance.

For an overview of how formats, manifests, and creative agents work together, see the [Creative Protocol Overview](/docs/creative).


## Manifest Structure

### Basic Structure

```typescript
{
  format_id: {                 // Format this manifest is for
    agent_url: string;         // Creative agent URL
    id: string;                // Format identifier
  };
  assets: {
    [asset_id: string]: {      // Keyed by asset_id from format's assets
      // Asset type is determined by format specification, not declared here
      // Type-specific fields depend on asset_type defined in format's assets

      // Image: url, width, height, format, alt_text
      // Video: url, width, height, duration_ms, format, bitrate_kbps
      // Audio: url, duration_ms, format, bitrate_kbps
      // Text: content, language
      // Markdown: content, flavor
      // URL: url, description
      // HTML: content or url, version
      // CSS: content, media
      // JavaScript: content, module_type
      // VAST: url or content, vast_version, vpaid_enabled, duration_ms, tracking_events
      // DAAST: url or content, daast_version, duration_ms, tracking_events, companion_ads
      // Webhook: url, method, timeout_ms, response_type, security, supported_macros, required_macros
      // Brief: name, objective, tone, audience, messaging, compliance
      // Catalog: type, catalog_id, items, selectors
    }
  };
}
```

### Asset IDs

Each asset in a manifest is keyed by its `asset_id`, which must match an `asset_id` defined in the format's `assets` array. The asset ID serves as the technical identifier for referencing the asset requirement in the format specification.

**How Asset IDs Work**:

When a format defines required assets:
```json
{
  "assets": [
    {
      "asset_id": "banner_image",
      "asset_type": "image",
      "required": true
    },
    {
      "asset_id": "clickthrough_url",
      "asset_type": "url",
      "required": true
    }
  ]
}
```

Your manifest **must use those exact asset IDs** as keys:
```json
{
  "assets": {
    "banner_image": {        // ← Matches asset_id from format
      "url": "https://cdn.example.com/banner.jpg",
      "width": 300,
      "height": 250
    },
    "clickthrough_url": {    // ← Matches asset_id from format
      "url": "https://example.com/landing"
    }
  }
}
```

**Common Asset IDs** (vary by format):
- `banner_image`, `hero_image`: Primary visual assets
- `logo`: Brand logo
- `headline`, `description`: Text content
- `cta_text`: Call-to-action button text
- `video_file`: Video content
- `vast_tag`: VAST XML for video delivery
- `clickthrough_url`: Landing page URL

Always check the specific format's `assets` to see which asset IDs are required.

### Complete Example

Here's a complete creative manifest showing the current structure without redundant fields:

```json
{
  "$schema": "/schemas/core/creative-manifest.json",
  "format_id": {
    "agent_url": "https://creative.adcontextprotocol.org",
    "id": "display_300x250"
  },
  "assets": {
    "banner_image": {
      "url": "https://cdn.example.com/banner.jpg",
      "width": 300,
      "height": 250
    },
    "headline": {
      "content": "Nutrition Dogs Love"
    },
    "description": {
      "content": "Made with real chicken and wholesome grains"
    },
    "clickthrough_url": {
      "url": "https://example.com/products/premium-dog-food",
      "description": "Product landing page"
    }
  }
}
```

**Note**: Asset types (`image`, `text`, `url`) are **not** declared in the manifest. They are determined by looking up each `asset_id` in the format specification's `assets` array. The format tells us that `banner_image` should be type `image`, `headline` should be type `text`, etc.

## Types of Creative Manifests

Creative manifests can be static, dynamic, or hybrid - reflecting the three creative agent modalities above.

### Static Manifests

Static manifests contain all assets ready for immediate rendering. These are produced by creative agents in **Static Asset Delivery** or **Prompt to Static Rendering** modes.

```json
{
  "$schema": "/schemas/core/creative-manifest.json",
  "format_id": {
    "agent_url": "https://creative.adcontextprotocol.org",
    "id": "native_responsive"
  },
  "assets": {
    "hero_image": {
      "url": "https://cdn.example.com/hero.jpg",
      "width": 1200,
      "height": 627,
      "alt_text": "Product image"
    },
    "logo": {
      "url": "https://cdn.example.com/logo.png",
      "width": 100,
      "height": 100
    },
    "headline": {
      "content": "Premium Quality You Can Trust"
    },
    "description": {
      "content": "Discover why veterinarians recommend our formula"
    },
    "cta_text": {
      "content": "Learn More"
    }
  }
}
```

**Use Cases**:
- Traditional display advertising
- Pre-rendered video ads
- Static native ads
- Fixed creative campaigns

### Dynamic Manifests

Dynamic manifests include endpoints or code for real-time generation. These are produced by creative agents in **Prompt to Dynamic Rendering** mode (DCO/Generative).

```json
{
  "$schema": "/schemas/core/creative-manifest.json",
  "format_id": {
    "agent_url": "https://creative.adcontextprotocol.org",
    "id": "display_dynamic_300x250"
  },
  "assets": {
    "dynamic_content": {
      "url": "https://creative-agent.example.com/render/campaign-123",
      "method": "POST",
      "timeout_ms": 500,
      "supported_macros": ["WEATHER", "TIME", "DEVICE_TYPE", "COUNTRY"],
      "response_type": "html",
      "security": {
        "method": "hmac_sha256",
        "hmac_header": "X-Signature"
      }
    },
    "fallback_image": {
      "url": "https://cdn.example.com/fallback-300x250.jpg",
      "width": 300,
      "height": 250
    }
  }
}
```

**Use Cases**:
- Weather-based creative
- Time-of-day personalization
- Product availability messaging
- Real-time inventory updates

**Note**: For client-side dynamic rendering, use `html` or `javascript` asset types with embedded tags instead of webhooks.

**Dynamic manifests can mix asset types** - some assets may be static (images, videos) while others are dynamic (webhooks, tags with macros). For example, a video VAST tag with a static hero video but a personalized end card webhook.

### DOOH Manifests with Impression Tracking

Digital Out-of-Home (DOOH) creatives use impression tracking just like other formats, but with venue-specific macros instead of device identifiers.

```json test=false
{
  "format_id": {
    "agent_url": "https://creative.adcontextprotocol.org",
    "id": "dooh_billboard_1920x1080"
  },
  "assets": {
    "billboard_image": {
      "url": "https://cdn.example.com/billboard-1920x1080.jpg",
      "width": 1920,
      "height": 1080
    },
    "impression_tracker": {
      "url": "https://tracking.example.com/imp?screen={SCREEN_ID}&venue={VENUE_TYPE}&ts={PLAY_TIMESTAMP}&lat={VENUE_LAT}&lon={VENUE_LONG}",
      "url_type": "tracker_pixel"
    }
  }
}
```

**DOOH-Specific Macros** (see [Universal Macros](/docs/creative/universal-macros) for complete list):
- `{SCREEN_ID}` - Unique identifier for the physical screen
- `{VENUE_TYPE}` - Venue category (airport, mall, transit, highway, retail)
- `{VENUE_LAT}` / `{VENUE_LONG}` - Physical location coordinates
- `{PLAY_TIMESTAMP}` - When creative displayed (Unix timestamp)
- `{DWELL_TIME}` - Average viewer dwell time at this location

The mechanics are identical to digital impression tracking - a URL fires when the ad displays. The difference is DOOH uses fixed venue context instead of dynamic device identifiers.

## Working with Manifests

### Creating Manifests

Manifests are JSON structures that can be created in two ways:

**1. Manual Assembly**

Construct manifests directly by pairing format requirements with your assets:

```json
{
  "$schema": "/schemas/core/creative-manifest.json",
  "format_id": {
    "agent_url": "https://creative.adcontextprotocol.org",
    "id": "native_responsive"
  },
  "assets": {
    "hero_image": {
      "url": "https://cdn.example.com/salmon-hero.jpg",
      "width": 1200,
      "height": 627
    },
    "headline": {
      "content": "New Premium Salmon Formula"
    }
  }
}
```

**2. AI-Generated (Optional)**

Use `build_creative` to have a creative agent generate manifests from natural language briefs. See [Generative Creative](/docs/creative/generative-creative) for details.

### Validating Manifests

Before using a manifest, validate it against format requirements:

1. **Format Compatibility**: Ensure `format_id` matches intended format
2. **Required Assets**: All required `asset_id` values from the format are present as keys in the manifest's `assets` object
3. **Asset Key Matching**: Each key in the manifest's `assets` object MUST match an `asset_id` from the format's `assets` array
4. **Asset Specifications**: Each asset meets format requirements (dimensions, file size, duration, etc.)
5. **Macro Support**: Dynamic manifests properly handle required macros

**What happens with invalid asset keys?**

- **Missing required asset_id**: Creative agents MUST reject the manifest with an error listing which required assets are missing
- **Unknown asset_id**: Creative agents MUST reject manifests containing asset keys that don't match any `asset_id` in the format. This catches typos and incompatible formats immediately.
- **Wrong asset_type**: If an asset doesn't match the type requirement for that `asset_id` in the format specification, reject with a clear type mismatch error

Creative agents that implement `build_creative` handle validation automatically. For manually constructed manifests, validate against the format specification returned by `list_creative_formats`.

**Format-Aware Validation**: Creative manifest validation MUST be performed in the context of the format specification. The format defines what type each `asset_id` should be, eliminating any validation ambiguity. Asset type information is NOT included in the manifest itself - it's determined by looking up the `asset_id` in the format's `assets` array.

#### Validation Flow

When a creative agent receives a manifest for validation:

1. **Extract format_id** from the manifest
2. **Fetch format specification** from the format registry (local or remote based on `agent_url`)
3. **For each asset key in `manifest.assets`:**
   - Look up the `asset_id` in `format.assets`
   - If not found → **reject** with error "Unknown asset_id 'banner_imag' not defined in format"
   - If found → determine the expected `asset_type` from the format requirement
   - Fetch the asset type schema (e.g., `/schemas/v2/core/assets/image-asset.json`)
   - Validate the asset payload against that schema
   - Validate the asset meets any additional constraints in the format's `requirements` field
4. **Check all required assets are present** (where `required: true` in format spec)
5. **Validate type-specific constraints** (dimensions, file size, duration, etc.)

The format specification is the single source of truth for what type each `asset_id` should be and what constraints apply.

**Validation is runtime, not schema-time**: The JSON schema for creative manifests uses a flexible pattern (`^[a-z0-9_]+$`) for asset keys because the valid keys depend on which format you're using. Validation against the specific format's `assets` happens when you submit the manifest to a creative agent.

### Previewing Manifests

Use the `preview_creative` task to see how a manifest will render:

```json
{
  "creative_manifest": {
    "format_id": {
      "agent_url": "https://creative.adcontextprotocol.org",
      "id": "native_responsive"
    },
    "assets": {
      "hero_image": {
        "url": "https://cdn.example.com/hero.jpg",
        "width": 1200,
        "height": 627
      },
      // ... other assets
    }
  },
  "macro_values": {
    "CLICK_URL": "https://example.com/landing",
    "CACHE_BUSTER": "12345"
  }
}
```

The creative agent returns preview URLs and renderings.

### Submitting Manifests

Manifests are submitted to the creative library using `sync_creatives`, then referenced by ID in media buys:

```json
{
  "task": "sync_creatives",
  "parameters": {
    "creatives": [
      {
        "creative_id": "native-salmon-v1",
        "name": "Salmon Special Native Ad",
        "format_id": {
          "agent_url": "https://creative.adcontextprotocol.org",
          "id": "native_responsive"
        },
        "manifest": {
          "format_id": {
            "agent_url": "https://creative.adcontextprotocol.org",
            "id": "native_responsive"
          },
          "assets": {
            "product_catalog": {
              "catalog_id": "salmon-products",
              "type": "product"
            },
            "headline": {
              "content": "Fresh Pacific Salmon - 20% Off Today"
            },
            "main_image": {
              "url": "https://cdn.example.com/salmon.jpg",
              "width": 1200,
              "height": 628
            }
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Then reference in media buys by `creative_id`. Each manifest is for a single format.

## Macro Substitution in Manifests

Manifests support macro placeholders for dynamic values. AdCP uses universal macros that work consistently across all publishers.

See [Universal Macros](/docs/creative/universal-macros) for complete documentation on available macros, macro substitution process, and format-specific macro support.


## Best Practices

### For Creative Agents

1. **Complete Manifests**: Include all required assets for the format
2. **Validate Assets**: Ensure assets meet format specifications
3. **Provide Fallbacks**: Include fallback assets for dynamic creatives
4. **Document Macros**: Clearly specify which macros are used
5. **Version Assets**: Use versioned URLs for asset management

### For Publishers

1. **Validate on Receipt**: Check manifests against format requirements
2. **Cache Assets**: Pre-fetch and cache hosted assets
3. **Handle Failures**: Implement fallback rendering for dynamic manifests
4. **Support Macros**: Implement full Universal Macro support
5. **Provide Templates**: Offer rendering templates for custom formats

### For Buyers

1. **Validate Manifests**: Ensure manifests match format requirements (manually or via `build_creative`)
2. **Preview First**: Always preview manifests before submission
3. **Test Macros**: Verify macro substitution works as expected
4. **Optimize Assets**: Ensure assets are properly sized and compressed
5. **Organize Libraries**: Use creative libraries for asset management

## Advanced Topics

### Catalogs

Manifests for catalog-driven formats (product carousels, dynamic product ads) include their catalogs as assets within the `assets` map. See [Catalogs in Creatives](/docs/creative/catalogs#catalogs-in-creatives) for the workflow.

### Repeatable Asset Groups

For carousel, slideshow, and multi-asset formats, see the [Carousel & Multi-Asset Formats](/docs/creative/channels/carousels) guide for complete documentation on repeatable asset groups.
