## Key Concepts

### What AdCP Provides

AdCP is an open standard for AI-powered advertising workflows. It provides:

- **Unified interface** for media buying across diverse advertising platforms
- **Protocol-agnostic tasks** that work with both MCP and A2A
- **Async-first design** for operations that may take seconds, hours, or days
- **Human-in-the-loop support** for approvals and manual oversight

### Design Philosophy

1. **AI-Optimized**: Designed for AI agents, not just human users
2. **Platform Agnostic**: Works across ad platforms (Google, Meta, Amazon, etc.)
3. **Asynchronous**: Operations may complete immediately or require manual approval
4. **MCP-Based**: Built on the Model Context Protocol foundation
5. **Human-in-the-Loop**: Optional manual approval for sensitive operations

### The AdCP Stack

```
Your Application / AI Agent
          ↓
    [MCP or A2A Protocol]
          ↓
      AdCP Tasks
          ↓
    Sales Agents (Ad Servers)
          ↓
   Ad Platforms & Publishers
```

Both protocols provide the same AdCP tasks - they're just different ways to communicate.
