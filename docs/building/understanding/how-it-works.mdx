title: How AdCP Works
description: Design principles and architecture of the Ad Context Protocol
---

AdCP (Ad Context Protocol) is an open standard for AI-powered advertising workflows. It provides a unified interface for media buying across diverse advertising platforms.

## The Core Idea

Traditional ad tech requires integrations with dozens of different platforms, each with its own API, data models, and workflows. AdCP provides a single, AI-optimized interface that works across all of them.

```
Your Application / AI Agent
          ↓
    [MCP or A2A Protocol]
          ↓
      AdCP Tasks
          ↓
    Sales Agents (Ad Servers)
          ↓
   Ad Platforms & Publishers
```

**Sales Agents** are the key abstraction. They implement AdCP tasks and translate them to specific ad platforms (Google Ad Manager, The Trade Desk, Meta, etc.). Your code talks to AdCP; the sales agent handles the platform complexity.

## Design Principles

### 1. AI-Optimized

AdCP is designed for AI agents, not just human users. This means:

- **Natural language briefs**: Describe what you want, not how to configure it
- **Conversational refinement**: Agents can ask clarifying questions
- **Structured data**: Responses include machine-readable data alongside human-readable messages

### 2. Protocol Agnostic

AdCP tasks work with both MCP (Model Context Protocol) and A2A (Agent-to-Agent) protocols:

- **Same tasks**: `get_products`, `create_media_buy`, etc.
- **Same capabilities**: All features work with both protocols
- **Different transports**: MCP uses tool calls; A2A uses task messages

Choose based on your ecosystem, not based on what AdCP supports.

### 3. Asynchronous First

Ad operations can take seconds, hours, or days:

- **Immediate**: Simple queries return instantly
- **Processing**: Complex operations take seconds to minutes
- **Manual approval**: Some operations require human sign-off

AdCP handles all of these with a unified status system and optional webhooks.

### 4. Human-in-the-Loop

Sensitive operations can require manual approval:

- Budget thresholds (e.g., campaigns over $100K)
- New advertiser onboarding
- Policy-sensitive content

The `input-required` status pauses execution until a human approves.

### 5. Platform Agnostic

One interface works across all supported platforms:

- Google Ad Manager
- The Trade Desk
- Meta (Facebook/Instagram)
- Amazon Ads
- And more...

Sales agents handle the translation layer.

## Key Concepts

### Tasks

Tasks are the operations you can perform:

| Task | What It Does |
|------|--------------|
| `get_products` | Discover available inventory |
| `list_creative_formats` | See supported creative formats |
| `create_media_buy` | Purchase advertising |
| `sync_creatives` | Upload creative assets |
| `get_media_buy_delivery` | Check campaign performance |

Tasks are the same regardless of which protocol you use.

### Status System

Every response includes a `status` field:

| Status | Meaning | Your Action |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `completed` | Done | Process the results |
| `working` | Processing (< 2 min) | Poll for updates |
| `submitted` | Long-running (hours/days) | Use webhook or poll |
| `input-required` | Needs user input | Prompt user, continue |
| `failed` | Error occurred | Handle the error |

### Context and Sessions

AdCP maintains conversation state:

- **`context_id`**: Session identifier for conversation continuity
- **`task_id`**: Identifier for tracking specific operations

Context lets agents remember previous requests and refine results conversationally.

### Sales Agents

Sales agents are server implementations that:

- Expose AdCP tasks
- Translate to specific ad platforms
- Handle authentication and authorization
- Manage inventory and pricing

You connect to sales agents, not directly to ad platforms.

## What AdCP Is Not

- **Not a DSP**: AdCP doesn't buy ads itself; it provides an interface to systems that do
- **Not a replacement for RTB**: AdCP is for agentic, relationship-based buying, not real-time auctions
- **Not a creative tool**: AdCP handles creative *management*, not creative *creation*
