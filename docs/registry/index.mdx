description: Public REST API for brand resolution, property resolution, agent discovery, and authorization validation
---

The AgenticAdvertising.org registry provides a public REST API for resolving brands and properties, discovering agents, and validating authorization in the AdCP ecosystem.

## Base URL

```
https://agenticadvertising.org
```

All endpoints listed here are **public and require no authentication**.

## Quick Start

Resolve a brand domain to its canonical identity:

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl "https://agenticadvertising.org/api/brands/resolve?domain=acmecorp.com"
```

```javascript JavaScript
const res = await fetch(
  "https://agenticadvertising.org/api/brands/resolve?domain=acmecorp.com"
);
const brand = await res.json();
console.log(brand.brand_name, brand.canonical_domain);
```

```python Python
import requests

brand = requests.get(
    "https://agenticadvertising.org/api/brands/resolve",
    params={"domain": "acmecorp.com"}
).json()
print(brand["brand_name"], brand["canonical_domain"])
```

</CodeGroup>

```json Response
{
  "canonical_id": "acmecorp.com",
  "canonical_domain": "acmecorp.com",
  "brand_name": "Acme Corp",
  "keller_type": "master",
  "house_domain": "acmecorp.com",
  "source": "brand_json"
}
```

## Rate Limits

| Endpoint | Limit |
|----------|-------|
| Bulk resolve (`/api/brands/resolve/bulk`, `/api/properties/resolve/bulk`) | 20 requests/minute per IP |
| All other endpoints | No limit |

Bulk endpoints return `429 Too Many Requests` when the limit is exceeded.

## Protocol vs REST API

The AdCP protocol defines MCP and A2A tasks for agent-to-agent communication (e.g. `get_products`, `create_media_buy`). The registry REST API is separate — it provides HTTP endpoints for looking up entities in the AgenticAdvertising.org registry.

**Use the REST API** for discovery and authorization:
- Resolve brand or property domains before making protocol calls
- Discover which agents exist and what they're authorized for
- Validate authorization in real time during ad serving
- Build integrations that browse or search the registry

**Use MCP/A2A tasks** for transactional operations:
- Fetching products from a sales agent (`get_products`)
- Creating media buys (`create_media_buy`)
- Building creatives (`build_creative`)
- Getting signals (`get_signals`)

A typical integration uses both: resolve a publisher domain via the registry API, then call the authorized agent's MCP endpoint to transact.
