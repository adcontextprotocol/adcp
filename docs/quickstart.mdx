# AdCP Quickstart Guide

Get started with AdCP in 5 minutes. This guide shows you how to test AdCP, understand authentication, and make your first requests.

## Try AdCP Right Now

### Interactive Testing Platform

The fastest way to explore AdCP is through our **interactive testing platform**:

üîó **[https://testing.adcontextprotocol.org](https://testing.adcontextprotocol.org)**

This platform lets you:
- Test all AdCP tasks interactively
- See real request/response examples
- Validate your understanding of the protocol
- Try different scenarios without writing code

### Test Agent for Development

For developers building AdCP integrations, we provide a **public test agent** with free credentials:

**Agent URL**: `https://test-agent.adcontextprotocol.org`

**Agent Card**: [https://test-agent.adcontextprotocol.org/.well-known/agent-card.json](https://test-agent.adcontextprotocol.org/.well-known/agent-card.json)

**Free Test Credentials**:

**For MCP Protocol**:
```json
{
  "agent_uri": "https://test-agent.adcontextprotocol.org/mcp",
  "protocol": "mcp",
  "version": "1.0",
  "auth": {
    "type": "bearer",
    "token": "1v8tAhASaUYYp4odoQ1PnMpdqNaMiTrCRqYo9OJp6IQ"
  }
}
```

**For A2A Protocol**:
```json
{
  "agent_uri": "https://test-agent.adcontextprotocol.org/a2a",
  "protocol": "a2a",
  "version": "1.0",
  "auth": {
    "type": "bearer",
    "token": "L4UCklW_V_40eTdWuQYF6HD5GWeKkgV8U6xxK-jwNO8"
  }
}
```

**What You Can Do**:
- ‚úÖ Test all AdCP tasks with authentication
- ‚úÖ See complete product catalogs with pricing
- ‚úÖ Create test media buys (with dry run mode)
- ‚úÖ Upload and sync test creatives
- ‚úÖ Practice integration patterns

**Important**: This is a test agent. Data is ephemeral and may be reset. Use dry run mode to avoid creating actual test campaigns.

## Understanding Authentication

AdCP uses a tiered authentication model - some operations work without credentials, while others require authentication.

### Operations That DON'T Require Authentication

These **capability discovery** operations work without credentials:

- ‚úÖ **`list_creative_formats`** - Browse available creative formats
- ‚úÖ **`list_authorized_properties`** - See which properties an agent represents
- ‚úÖ **`get_products`** - Discover inventory (limited results without auth)

**Why these are public**: Publishers want potential buyers to discover their inventory and understand their capabilities before establishing a relationship.

**Important**: Unauthenticated `get_products` requests may return:
- Limited product catalog
- No pricing information
- Generic products only
- No custom offerings

### Operations That REQUIRE Authentication

These operations require valid credentials:

- üîí **`get_products`** (full results) - See complete catalog with pricing
- üîí **`create_media_buy`** - Create advertising campaigns
- üîí **`update_media_buy`** - Modify existing campaigns
- üîí **`sync_creatives`** - Upload creative assets
- üîí **`list_creatives`** - View your creative library
- üîí **`get_media_buy_delivery`** - Monitor campaign performance
- üîí **`provide_performance_feedback`** - Submit optimization signals

**Why authentication is required**: These operations involve financial commitments, access to proprietary data, or modifications to campaigns.

## Getting Credentials

To access authenticated operations, you need to establish an account with each sales agent you want to work with.

### How to Get Access

**1. Contact the Sales Agent**

Each AdCP sales agent manages their own accounts and credentials. Find their contact information via:

- The agent's website (discovered via `adagents.json`)
- Direct outreach to the publisher
- Through aggregation platforms (like Scope3)

**2. Credential Types**

Sales agents typically support one or both:

- **API Keys**: Simple header-based authentication (`X-API-Key: <key>`)
- **JWT Tokens**: OAuth-based authentication (`Authorization: Bearer <token>`)

See [Authentication Reference](/docs/reference/authentication) for technical details.

**3. Dynamic Registration (Optional)**

Some sales agents support OAuth-based dynamic registration - check their documentation or `adagents.json` file for details.

### Working with Multiple Agents

**Important**: You need separate credentials for each sales agent.

```
Your App
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Sales Agent A (ESPN inventory)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Requires ESPN credentials
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Sales Agent B (Weather.com inventory)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Requires Weather.com credentials
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Sales Agent C (Multi-publisher network)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Requires network credentials
```

**Aggregation Platforms**: Consider using platforms like Scope3 that manage credentials and relationships with multiple sales agents on your behalf.

## Your First Request

Let's make a test request using the public test agent with authentication.

### Step 1: Test with Authentication

Use the test agent credentials provided above to make an authenticated request:

**Using MCP (JSON-RPC 2.0)**:

```bash
curl -X POST https://test-agent.adcontextprotocol.org/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer 1v8tAhASaUYYp4odoQ1PnMpdqNaMiTrCRqYo9OJp6IQ" \
  -H "Accept: application/json, text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": "req-123",
    "method": "tools/call",
    "params": {
      "name": "get_products",
      "arguments": {
        "promoted_offering": "Nike Air Max 2024 - latest innovation in cushioning technology"
      }
    }
  }'
```

**Expected Response** (Server-Sent Events format):

```
event: message
data: {"status":"success","products":[...],"message":"Found 3 products..."}
```

### Step 2: Interpret the Response

The response includes:
- **`message`**: Human-readable summary of results
- **`products`**: Array of available inventory products with pricing information
- **`context_id`**: Session identifier for follow-up requests

**With authentication**, you'll see:
- ‚úÖ Complete product catalog
- ‚úÖ Pricing information (CPM, min_spend)
- ‚úÖ Custom product offerings
- ‚úÖ Measurement capabilities

### Step 3: Try Without Authentication

Compare by making the same request **without** the Authorization header:

```bash
curl -X POST https://test-agent.adcontextprotocol.org/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json, text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": "req-123",
    "method": "tools/call",
    "params": {
      "name": "get_products",
      "arguments": {
        "promoted_offering": "Nike Air Max 2024 - latest innovation in cushioning technology"
      }
    }
  }'
```

You'll notice fewer products and missing pricing details - this demonstrates the tiered authentication model.

## Testing with Dry Run Mode

AdCP supports comprehensive testing without spending real money or affecting production systems.

### Enable Dry Run Mode

Add the `X-Dry-Run` header to any request:

```bash
curl -X POST <agent-url> \
  -H "X-Dry-Run: true" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -d '{...}'
```

**What Dry Run Does**:
- ‚úÖ Validates your request structure
- ‚úÖ Returns realistic simulated responses
- ‚úÖ Tests error scenarios
- ‚ùå Does NOT create real campaigns
- ‚ùå Does NOT spend actual money
- ‚ùå Does NOT affect production systems

## Protocol Choice: MCP vs A2A

AdCP tasks work identically across protocols - choose based on your technical needs:

### Use MCP if:
- You're integrating with Claude or MCP-compatible AI assistants
- You prefer direct tool-calling patterns
- Your client already supports MCP

### Use A2A if:
- You're using Google's agent ecosystem
- You prefer message-based interactions with Server-Sent Events
- Your client already supports A2A

**The tasks are the same** - `get_products`, `create_media_buy`, etc. work identically in both protocols, just with different request/response wrappers.

**Learn more**: [Protocol Comparison](/docs/protocols/protocol-comparison)

## Using the NPM Client

If you're building in Node.js, use the official AdCP client:

```bash
npm install @adcp/client
```

**Example usage with test agent**:

```javascript
import { AdcpClient } from '@adcp/client';

// Use the public test agent
const client = new AdcpClient({
  agentUrl: 'https://test-agent.adcontextprotocol.org/mcp',
  protocol: 'mcp',
  bearerToken: '1v8tAhASaUYYp4odoQ1PnMpdqNaMiTrCRqYo9OJp6IQ'  // Test agent token
});

// Test authenticated product discovery
const products = await client.getProducts({
  promoted_offering: 'Nike Air Max 2024 - innovative cushioning technology'
});

console.log(`Found ${products.products.length} products`);
console.log('First product:', products.products[0]);

// Test with dry run mode
const mediaBuy = await client.createMediaBuy({
  product_id: products.products[0].product_id,
  budget: 10000,
  start_date: '2025-11-01',
  end_date: '2025-11-30'
}, {
  dryRun: true  // No actual campaign created
});

console.log('Test media buy created:', mediaBuy.media_buy_id);
```

## Common Issues

### "Invalid request parameters" Error

**Problem**: You're sending incorrect parameters or using an outdated schema.

**Solution**:
1. Verify you're using the latest AdCP version (check [schema registry](https://adcontextprotocol.org/schemas/v1/index.json))
2. Check parameter names match the [task reference docs](/docs/media-buy/task-reference/get_products)
3. Use the testing platform to validate your request structure

### Missing Pricing Information

**Problem**: Products return without CPM or pricing details.

**Solution**: You need to authenticate. Unauthenticated requests only return limited public information.

### "Authentication required" Error

**Problem**: Trying to access an authenticated operation without credentials.

**Solution**: [Get credentials](#getting-credentials) from the sales agent, then include them in your request headers.
