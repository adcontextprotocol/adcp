# Recommendation: Build AdCP on A2A Protocol

## Executive Summary

After analyzing both protocols, we recommend building AdCP on Google's A2A protocol as the foundational layer, with MCP provided as a compatibility interface. A2A's Task abstraction is fundamentally better suited for advertising workflows than MCP's request/response model.

## Key Reasons

### 1. Tasks Are Perfect for Advertising Workflows

Advertising operations are inherently task-based:
- **Media Buy Creation**: Multi-step process with checkpoints
- **Creative Review**: Iterative workflow with approvals
- **Campaign Optimization**: Long-running analysis and adjustments

A2A Tasks provide:
- Native status progression (pending → working → completed)
- Built-in human-in-the-loop states
- Real-time progress updates via SSE
- Context preservation across interactions

### 2. Human-in-the-Loop is First-Class

Current AdCP must build HITL on top of MCP:
```javascript
// MCP: Return error, build custom task system
return { 
  error: { 
    code: "APPROVAL_REQUIRED", 
    task_id: "custom_task_123" 
  } 
}
```

With A2A, it's native:
```javascript
// A2A: Natural task state
await task.update({
  status: { state: "pending_approval" },
  message: "Awaiting compliance review"
})
```

### 3. Context Management for Complex Workflows

The `contextId` elegantly handles multi-step processes:
- Upload creative → Get feedback → Make changes → Get approval
- All in one conversational context
- No manual state threading between API calls

### 4. Real-Time Status Updates

Clients can see what's happening:
- "Checking inventory availability..."
- "Validating targeting parameters..."
- "Submitting to ad server..."
- "Awaiting publisher approval..."

This transparency is crucial for enterprise workflows.

```

## Implementation Path

### Phase 1: Build on A2A (Q2 2025)
- Implement core workflows using A2A Tasks
- Use contextId for campaign management
- Native HITL support from day one

### Phase 2: MCP Compatibility (Q3 2025)
- Add MCP adapter for existing integrations
- Translate MCP tools to A2A tasks
- Maintain backward compatibility

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Q4 2025)
- Multi-agent collaboration
- Cross-platform orchestration
- Advanced artifact handling

## Example: Media Buy as A2A Task

```javascript
// Natural workflow with status updates
Client: "Create $100K CTV campaign for sports fans"

Agent: Task "task-mb-001" created
  ↓ Status: "Analyzing requirements..."
  ↓ Status: "Found 12 suitable products"
  ↓ Status: "Optimizing budget allocation..."
  ↓ Status: "Creating campaign..." 
  ↓ Status: "Pending approval (compliance required)"
  
Client: "Approved"

Agent: Task completed
  → Artifact: media_buy_confirmation.json
  → Artifact: insertion_order.pdf
```

## Risk Mitigation

### Concern: "A2A is newer/less proven"
**Mitigation**: 
- Backed by Google and Linux Foundation
- 100+ partners already committed
- MCP compatibility ensures fallback option

### Concern: "Existing MCP integrations"
**Mitigation**:
- MCP adapter provides full compatibility
- No breaking changes for current users
- Gradual migration path

### Concern: "Implementation complexity"
**Mitigation**:
- A2A actually simplifies implementation
- No need to build task management
- Reference implementations available

## Conclusion

A2A's Task model is not just compatible with advertising workflows—it's designed for them. By building AdCP on A2A:

1. **Immediate Benefits**:
   - Native HITL support
   - Real-time status updates
   - Context-aware workflows
   - Simplified implementation

2. **Future Benefits**:
   - Access to A2A ecosystem
   - Multi-agent collaboration
   - Advanced features (UI embedding, etc.)

3. **No Downside**:
   - MCP compatibility maintained
   - Better architecture overall
   - Future-proof design

## Recommendation

**Build AdCP agents on A2A protocol with MCP as a compatibility layer.** This positions AdCP at the forefront of agent interoperability while providing a superior developer and user experience.

## Next Steps

1. Engage with A2A community
2. Build proof-of-concept A2A agent
3. Update AdCP specification
4. Create migration guide for existing implementations
