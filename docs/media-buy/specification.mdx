The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119).

## Abstract

The Media Buy Protocol defines a standard interface for AI-powered advertising automation. This protocol enables AI agents to discover advertising inventory, create and manage campaigns, synchronize creative assets, and track performance through natural language interactions.

## Protocol Overview

The Media Buy Protocol provides:

- Natural language inventory discovery based on campaign briefs
- Campaign creation with package-level budget and targeting
- Creative asset management and synchronization
- Performance tracking and optimization feedback
- Human-in-the-loop approval workflows

## Transport Requirements

Sales agents MUST support at least one of the following transports:

| Transport | Protocol | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| MCP | Model Context Protocol | Tool-based interaction via JSON-RPC |
| A2A | Agent-to-Agent | Message-based interaction |

Sales agents SHOULD support MCP as the preferred transport.

Sales agents MUST declare Media Buy Protocol support via `get_adcp_capabilities`:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://adcontextprotocol.org/schemas/v2/protocol/get-adcp-capabilities-response.json",
  "adcp": { "major_versions": [2] },
  "supported_protocols": ["media_buy"]
}
```

## Core Concepts

### Request Roles

Every media buy request involves three entities:

- **Orchestrator**: The platform making the API request (e.g., DSP, trading desk)
- **Account**: The billing relationship—who gets billed and what rates apply (identified by `account_id`)
- **Agent**: The entity placing the buy (identified by authentication token)

### Sales Agent Types

**Publisher Sales Agents** — represent a single publisher's inventory:
- Sales agents MUST only return products for inventory they are authorized to sell
- Sales agents MUST validate authorization via `adagents.json` when applicable

**Aggregator Sales Agents** — represent multiple publishers:
- Sales agents MUST clearly identify the source publisher for each product
- Sales agents MUST NOT misrepresent inventory provenance

### Identifiers

- **`media_buy_id`**: Unique identifier for a media buy. Sales agents MUST return this on successful creation. Orchestrators MUST use this for all subsequent operations on the media buy.

- **`package_id`**: Unique identifier for a package within a media buy. Sales agents MUST return this for each package created.

- **`buyer_ref`**: Client-provided reference for idempotency. Orchestrators SHOULD include this to enable retry safety.

### Asynchronous Operations

The Media Buy Protocol is asynchronous by design. Operations MAY return immediately or MAY require extended processing:

- **Synchronous responses**: Sales agents MAY return completed results immediately
- **Asynchronous responses**: Sales agents MAY return `status: "submitted"` or `status: "working"` with a task reference
- **Human-in-the-loop**: Sales agents MAY require manual approval, indicated by `status: "pending_approval"`

Orchestrators MUST handle all response types and MUST NOT assume synchronous completion.

## Tasks

The Media Buy Protocol defines ten tasks. See task reference pages for complete request/response schemas and examples.

- Sales agents SHOULD report `partial_failures` for individually failed events
- Sales agents SHOULD return `match_quality` score when user matching is attempted

## Error Handling

Sales agents MUST return errors using the [standard AdCP error schema](/docs/building/implementation/error-handling).

Common error codes:

- `MEDIA_BUY_NOT_FOUND`: Referenced media buy does not exist
- `PACKAGE_NOT_FOUND`: Referenced package does not exist
- `PRODUCT_NOT_FOUND`: Referenced product does not exist
- `BUDGET_EXCEEDED`: Operation would exceed allocated budget
- `CREATIVE_REJECTED`: Creative failed validation or approval
- `VALIDATION_ERROR`: Request format or parameter errors
- `UNAUTHORIZED`: Insufficient permissions for the operation

## Security Considerations

### Transport Security

All Media Buy Protocol communications MUST use HTTPS with TLS 1.2 or higher.

### Authentication

- Orchestrators MUST authenticate with sales agents using valid credentials
- Sales agents MUST validate credentials before processing requests
- Sales agents MUST use account context to determine inventory access

### Budget Authorization

- Sales agents MUST validate that accounts are authorized for requested budget levels
- Sales agents MUST NOT exceed authorized budget limits without explicit approval

### Creative Security

- Sales agents MUST validate creative content for policy compliance
- Sales agents SHOULD scan creatives for malware and malicious content
- Sales agents MUST NOT serve creatives that fail security validation

## Conformance

### Sales Agent Conformance

A conformant Media Buy Protocol sales agent MUST:

1. Support at least one specified transport (MCP or A2A)
2. Implement all eight tasks per their schemas
3. Return required fields as defined in response schemas
4. Use specified error codes
5. Handle asynchronous operations appropriately
6. Enforce authentication and authorization

### Orchestrator Conformance

A conformant Media Buy Protocol orchestrator MUST:

1. Authenticate with sales agents
2. Include required fields as defined in request schemas
3. Handle asynchronous responses (submitted, working, pending_approval)
4. Use `media_buy_id` for all operations on created media buys
5. Respect `creative_deadline` for creative uploads

## Implementation Notes

### Response Time Expectations

Sales agents SHOULD target the following response times:

| Operation Type | Target Latency |
|----------------|----------------|
| Simple lookups (list_creative_formats, list_creatives) | < 1 second |
| Discovery with AI/LLM (get_products) | < 60 seconds |
| Reporting queries (get_media_buy_delivery) | < 60 seconds |
| Campaign operations (create, update, sync) | Async acceptable |

### Idempotency

Sales agents SHOULD support idempotent operations using `buyer_ref`:

- If a `buyer_ref` has been seen before, sales agents SHOULD return the existing resource
- This enables safe retries without duplicate creation

### Human-in-the-Loop

Sales agents MAY require human approval for any operation. When approval is required:

- Sales agents MUST return `status: "pending_approval"`
- Sales agents SHOULD provide an estimated approval timeline
- Orchestrators SHOULD implement webhook handlers for status updates
