## Brief Writing Best Practices

### Describe Your Customer Naturally

Instead of prescribing targeting tactics, describe your customer's:
- **Situation**: What's happening in their life/business?
- **Challenges**: What problems do they face?
- **Values**: What matters to them?
- **Behaviors**: How do they research and buy?
- **Context**: When and why do they need you?

### Always Include Geographic Scope

- Specify countries explicitly
- Include currency (USD, EUR, GBP, etc.)
- Note regional focuses within countries
- Consider time zones for global campaigns

### Specify Format Preferences

Include format types to indicate channel strategy:
- **Display**: Standard web advertising
- **Video**: In-stream and out-stream video
- **Connected TV**: Television streaming ads
- **Audio**: Podcast and music streaming
- **Native**: Content-style advertising

### Let Publishers Add Value

Good briefs leave room for publisher expertise:
- Describe customers, not targeting parameters
- Share context, not just demographics
- Explain the "why" behind your campaign
- Allow for creative targeting suggestions
