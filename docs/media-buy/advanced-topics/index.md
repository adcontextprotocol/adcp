# Overview

This section covers advanced AdCP features and implementation details for experienced users who need deep technical understanding of the protocol's sophisticated capabilities.

Advanced topics include:

- **Targeting Systems** - Sophisticated audience and placement targeting
- **Dimensional Modeling** - Unified system for categorization and reporting  
- **Security & Access Control** - Multi-tenant security and permissions
- **Implementation Details** - Architecture decisions and design rationale
- **Development Tools** - Testing and development acceleration

## Core Advanced Concepts

### Targeting & Dimensions
AdCP uses a sophisticated dimensional system for consistent targeting and reporting:

- **[Targeting](./targeting)** - Layered targeting approach using dimensional attributes
- **[Dimensions](./dimensions)** - Unified system for categorizing products, targeting, and reporting

This system ensures you can report on exactly what you targeted, with consistent terminology across discovery, targeting, and analytics.

### Security & Access Control
Enterprise-grade security features for multi-tenant environments:

- **[Principals & Security](./principals-and-security)** - Multi-tenant security model and access control
- **[Policy Compliance](../media-buys/policy-compliance)** - Automated compliance checking and enforcement

### Implementation Architecture
Deep technical details for implementers:

- **[Orchestrator Design](./orchestrator-design)** - Technical architecture for AdCP orchestrators

## Development & Testing

### Development Tools
Accelerate development with AdCP's testing capabilities:

- **[Testing](./testing)** - Time simulation and dry run capabilities for faster development
- **Time simulation** for testing campaign timing without waiting
- **Dry run modes** for safe testing of live operations

### Performance Optimization
Understanding and optimizing AdCP implementations:
- **Response time expectations** for different operation types
- **Caching strategies** for improved performance  
- **Scalability considerations** for high-volume implementations

## Integration Patterns

### Multi-Platform Orchestration
Patterns for managing campaigns across multiple advertising platforms:
- **State synchronization** across platforms
- **Unified reporting** from diverse data sources
- **Cross-platform optimization** strategies

### AI Agent Integration
Best practices for AI agent implementations:
- **Natural language processing** for brief interpretation
- **Learning from performance** data for optimization
- **Error handling** and recovery strategies

## Advanced Targeting

### Layered Targeting Approach
AdCP's targeting system supports multiple layers of refinement:

1. **Product-level targeting** - Built into product definitions
2. **Package-level overlays** - Additional targeting refinements
3. **Real-time signals** - Dynamic targeting adjustments
4. **Frequency management** - Cross-campaign frequency control

### Dimensional Consistency
The same dimensional vocabulary used for:
- **Product categorization** during discovery
- **Targeting specification** during campaign creation
- **Performance reporting** during optimization

This ensures perfect alignment between intent and measurement.

## Enterprise Features

### Multi-Tenant Architecture
Support for agency and enterprise environments:
- **Principal isolation** for data security
- **Shared resources** where appropriate
- **Permission hierarchies** for complex organizations

### Compliance & Governance
Built-in features for regulatory compliance:
- **Audit trails** for all operations
- **Approval workflows** for sensitive operations
- **Data governance** controls and monitoring

## Technical Deep Dives

### Protocol Design Philosophy
Understanding the core principles behind AdCP:
- **MCP-based architecture** for AI-first interaction
- **Asynchronous by design** for real-world timing
- **Human-in-the-loop** when needed
- **Platform abstraction** for universal compatibility

### Performance Characteristics
Detailed understanding of system performance:
- **Response time categories** and expectations
- **Scalability limits** and considerations
- **Resource optimization** strategies
