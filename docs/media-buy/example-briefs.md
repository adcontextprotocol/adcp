## Notes on Brief Quality

These examples demonstrate the spectrum from minimal viable briefs to comprehensive campaign strategies. Key observations:

2. **Standard briefs** add audience definition and specific success metrics
3. **Comprehensive briefs** layer in detailed strategy, phased approaches, and specific requirements
4. **Industry context** matters - financial services requires compliance considerations, automotive needs longer consideration cycles

Each brief level serves different advertiser needs and campaign complexities. Publishers should be prepared to work with all levels, using the brief to inform product recommendations and campaign optimization strategies.
