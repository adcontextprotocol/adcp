# list_authorized_properties

Discover all advertising properties this sales agent is authorized to represent, enabling buyers to validate authorization via adagents.json and resolve property tags used in products.

**Response Time**: ~2 seconds (database lookup with potential pagination)

**Purpose**: 
- Authorization validation for buyer agents
- Property tag resolution for products that use `property_tags` instead of full `properties` arrays
- One-time discovery to cache property-to-domain mappings

**Request Schema**: [`/schemas/v1/media-buy/list-authorized-properties-request.json`](/schemas/v1/media-buy/list-authorized-properties-request.json)
**Response Schema**: [`/schemas/v1/media-buy/list-authorized-properties-response.json`](/schemas/v1/media-buy/list-authorized-properties-response.json)

## Request Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `tags` | string[] | No | Filter properties by specific tags (e.g., `["local_radio", "premium"]`) |

## Response (Message)

The response includes a human-readable message that:
- Summarizes the total number of authorized properties
- Explains tag groupings if applicable
- Notes any filtering applied

The message is returned differently in each protocol:
- **MCP**: Returned as a `message` field in the JSON response
- **A2A**: Returned as a text part in the artifact

### Field Descriptions

- **properties**: Array of all authorized properties (see [Property Schema](/schemas/v1/core/property.json))
- **tags**: Metadata for each tag used by properties
  - **name**: Human-readable name for the tag
  - **description**: Description of what the tag represents and optionally how many properties it includes
- **capabilities_description** *(optional)*: Markdown-formatted description of the sales agent's capabilities, inventory types, audience options, and special features. Used by buying agents to determine brief relevance.
- **markets** *(optional)*: Geographic market filtering for brief routing
  - **include_countries**: ISO country codes this agent accepts briefs for (mutually exclusive with exclude_countries)
  - **exclude_countries**: ISO country codes this agent does NOT accept briefs for (mutually exclusive with include_countries)
  - If neither specified, agent accepts briefs for any country

## Integration with get_products

This tool works in conjunction with [`get_products`](./get_products) to support two patterns:

### Pattern 1: Direct Properties
Products include full property objects directly:
```json
{
  "product_id": "sports_premium",
  "properties": [
    {
      "property_type": "website",
      "name": "ESPN.com",
      "identifiers": [{"type": "domain", "value": "espn.com"}],
      "publisher_domain": "espn.com"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Pattern 2: Property Tags (Recommended for Large Networks)
Products reference tags, requiring `list_authorized_properties` to resolve:
```json
{
  "product_id": "local_radio_midwest",
  "property_tags": ["local_radio", "midwest"]
}
```

To resolve tags to actual properties:
1. Call `list_authorized_properties()` once to get all properties
2. Filter properties where `tags` array includes the referenced tags
3. Use those properties for validation

## Validation Workflow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Buyer as Buyer Agent
    participant Sales as Sales Agent
    participant Publisher as Publisher Domain

    Note over Buyer: One-time Setup
    Buyer->>Sales: list_authorized_properties()
    Sales-->>Buyer: All property objects with tags
    
    Note over Buyer: Cache Validation Data
    loop For each property.publisher_domain
        Buyer->>Publisher: GET /.well-known/adagents.json
        Publisher-->>Buyer: Authorized agents list
        Buyer->>Buyer: Cache: domain â†’ authorized agents
    end
    
    Note over Buyer: Product Discovery
    Buyer->>Sales: get_products(...)
    Sales-->>Buyer: Products with properties OR property_tags
    
    Note over Buyer: Authorization Validation
    alt Product has properties array
        Buyer->>Buyer: Check each property.publisher_domain in cache
    else Product has property_tags
        Buyer->>Buyer: Resolve tags to properties from cached list
        Buyer->>Buyer: Check each resolved property.publisher_domain
    end
```

## Protocol-Specific Examples

The AdCP payload is identical across protocols. Only the request/response wrapper differs.

## Agent Capabilities and Market Filtering

### Capabilities Description

The optional `capabilities_description` field allows sales agents to describe their inventory, targeting capabilities, and special features in free-form markdown. This helps buying agents determine if a brief is relevant before sending product discovery requests.

**Best Practices**:
- Use markdown for light structure (bold, lists, etc.)
- Describe inventory types, formats, and channels
- Highlight audience targeting capabilities
- Mention special features or differentiators
- Keep concise but informative

**Example**:
```json
{
  "capabilities_description": "Premium DOOH network across North America. **Venues**: Airports, transit hubs, premium malls, office towers. **Audiences**: Business travelers, commuters, high net worth shoppers. **Special Features**: Dwell time targeting, dayparting, proof-of-play verification."
}
```

### Market Filtering

The optional `markets` object specifies which geographic markets the agent accepts briefs for. This enables orchestrators to route briefs efficiently without unnecessary requests.

**Include Countries** (positive list):
```json
{
  "markets": {
    "include_countries": ["US", "CA", "MX"]
  }
}
```
Agent only accepts briefs for US, Canada, and Mexico campaigns.

**Exclude Countries** (negative list):
```json
{
  "markets": {
    "exclude_countries": ["CN", "RU", "KP"]
  }
}
```
Agent accepts briefs for all countries except China, Russia, and North Korea.

**No markets field**: Agent accepts briefs for any country.

**Use Cases**:
- **Regulatory compliance**: US news publisher excludes restricted markets
- **Geographic focus**: EMEA-only network specifies European countries
- **Licensing restrictions**: Content rights limited to specific regions

## Use Cases

### Large Network Discovery
For agents representing thousands of properties (e.g., radio networks):
- Call once to get all properties and their tags
- Cache the property list for validation
- Products can reference `["local_radio"]` instead of listing 1847 stations

### Authorization Verification
For buyer agents validating seller authorization:
- Discover all domains this agent claims to represent
- Fetch adagents.json from each domain once
- Cache authorization status for fast product validation

### Tag Resolution
For products using `property_tags` instead of full property arrays:
- Use cached property list to resolve tags to actual properties
- Perform validation on the resolved properties
