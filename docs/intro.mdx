# Getting Started with Ad Context Protocol

:::info **🎉 AdCP v2.3.0 Released**
Major improvements: Publisher-owned property definitions via adagents.json, placement targeting for creative assignments, flexible product discovery with optional brand context, and streamlined budget management at package level. Plus webhook payload clarification and comprehensive security documentation. [See what's new →](/docs/reference/release-notes)
:::

Welcome to the Ad Context Protocol (AdCP) documentation. AdCP is an **open standard for advertising automation** that enables AI assistants to interact with advertising platforms through unified, standardized interfaces.

## What is Ad Context Protocol?

Ad Context Protocol (AdCP) is an **open standard for advertising automation** that enables AI-powered programmatic advertising workflows through:

- **Unified Advertising API**: Single interface for all advertising platforms
- **AI-Powered Automation**: Built on Model Context Protocol (MCP) for seamless AI integration
- **Multi-Protocol Support**: Access through MCP, A2A, or future protocols
- **Platform Agnostic**: Works with any compatible advertising platform
- **Programmatic Advertising Made Simple**: Standardized workflows across all ad tech

AdCP uses a task-first architecture where core advertising tasks (like creating media buys or discovering signals) can be accessed through multiple protocols:
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**: For direct AI assistant integration
- **A2A (Agent2Agent Protocol)**: For complex workflows and agent collaboration
- **REST API**: Coming soon for traditional integrations

All tasks and data models are defined with JSON schemas for validation and client code generation.

## Protocol Architecture

AdCP operates at multiple layers, providing a clean separation between the business roles, orchestration layer, and technical execution:

![Layers of the Stack](./layers-of-the-stack.png)

## The AdCP Ecosystem Layers

### Top Layer: Business Principals

#### Buying Principal (Left)
The demand side of advertising, including:
- **Advertisers**: Brands with products/services to promote
- **Agencies**: Acting on behalf of advertisers
- **Retail Media Networks**: Retailers monetizing their audiences
- **Curators**: Packaging inventory and data for specific use cases

#### Media Seller (Right)
The supply side of advertising, including:
- **Publishers**: Content creators with audience reach
- **Sales Houses**: Representing multiple publishers
- **Rep Firms**: Specialized sales representation
- **SSPs**: Supply-side platforms aggregating inventory
- **Ad Networks**: Aggregating and reselling inventory

These parties exchange impressions and money through the orchestration layer below.

### Middle Layer: Orchestration

#### Media Orchestration Platform (Left)
Platforms that evaluate sellers and audiences, and execute buying strategies:
- **Examples**: Scope3, custom orchestration solutions
- **Function**: Strategy execution, seller evaluation, optimization
- **Integration**: Uses MCP to communicate with both Audience and Sales Agents

#### Signal Agent (Right, Top)
MCP servers that provide:
- **Signal Discovery**: Finding relevant signals (audiences, contextual, geographical, temporal) using natural language
- **Signal Activation**: Pushing signals to decisioning platforms
- **Integration**: Connects signal platforms to orchestration via MCP

#### Sales Agent (Right, Bottom)
MCP servers that provide:
- **Media Product Discovery**: Natural language inventory search
- **Media Execution**: Creating and managing campaigns
- **Integration**: Exposes publisher capabilities via MCP

### Bottom Layer: Technical Execution

#### Agentic eXecution Engine (Left)
Real-time systems for:
- **Brand Safety**: Ensuring appropriate ad placement
- **Frequency Capping**: Managing exposure limits
- **First-Party Data**: Activating advertiser data
- **Integration**: Connects via key-value pairs or RTB protocols

#### Decisioning Platform (Right)
The technical infrastructure that:
- **Selects Impressions**: Decides which ad to serve
- **Delivery Method**: Direct campaigns or programmatic (RTB)
- **Examples**: DSPs, SSPs, Ad Servers, Google Ad Manager, Kevel

## The Complete AdCP Flow with Creative Agents

The AdCP ecosystem extends beyond media transactions to include creative production and delivery. This expanded view shows how creative agents integrate with the core AdCP components:

![AdCP Flows with Creative Agents](./adcp_flows.png)

### Three Interconnected Flows

#### Creative Flow (Top)
- **Creative Agent**: AI-powered creative generation and optimization
- **Property**: The publisher or platform displaying the ad
- **Consumer**: The end user viewing the advertisement

#### Business Flow (Middle)
- **Advertiser**: The brand with a message to deliver
- **Principal**: The buying principal (agency, trading desk, or brand itself)
- **Media Seller**: The supply-side entity selling ad inventory

#### Technical Flow (Bottom)
- **Brand Agent**: Represents the advertiser's objectives and brand guidelines
- **Media Agent**: Orchestrates the media buying process
- **Sales Agent**: Facilitates inventory discovery and transaction execution
- **Decisioning Platform**: Makes real-time ad serving decisions
- **AEE (Agent Execution Environment)**: Provides real-time execution capabilities

### How Creative Agents Enhance AdCP

Creative agents add a new dimension to the AdCP ecosystem:

1. **Dynamic Creative Generation**: Build creatives on-demand based on campaign objectives
2. **Format Adaptation**: Automatically adapt creative assets to different ad formats
3. **Real-time Optimization**: Adjust creative elements based on performance data
4. **Asset Management**: Organize and tag creative assets for efficient campaign execution

The creative flow operates in parallel with the business and technical flows, ensuring that the right creative reaches the right consumer at the right moment.

## How AdCP Protocols Work Together

Each AdCP protocol operates within this ecosystem:

### 🎯 Signals Activation Protocol
- **Scope**: Works with **signal platforms** to discover and activate signals directly on **decisioning platforms**
- **Integration**: Direct integration between signal agents and decisioning platforms (DSPs, injective platforms)
- **Workflow**: Find signals → Direct activation on target platform → Ready for campaign use

### 📍 Curation Protocol (Coming Soon)
- **Scope**: Works with **decisioning platforms** and **supply-side platforms**
- **Integration**: Curates inventory that will be targeted with activated signals
- **Workflow**: Define requirements → Find inventory → Package with signals

### 💰 Media Buy Protocol
- **Scope**: Works primarily with **decisioning platforms** (DSPs, injective platforms)
- **Integration**: Executes campaigns using curated inventory and activated signals
- **Workflow**: Set objectives → Execute buys → Optimize performance

### 🎨 Creative Agent Protocol
- **Scope**: Works with **creative generation and optimization** systems
- **Integration**: Builds creative assets and executable code for campaigns
- **Workflow**: Define brief → Generate creative → Refine and deploy

The AI assistant will:
1. Search for relevant signals across connected platforms
2. Show you options with transparent pricing
3. Activate your chosen signals for use on decisioning platforms
