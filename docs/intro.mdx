**AdCP 3.0 Release Candidate**

You're viewing the v3 release candidate documentation. This release adds AI provenance and disclosure, creative compliance, search and retail media, and 27 other features. See [what's new in 3.0](/docs/reference/release-notes#version-300-rc1) and the [AdCP v3 overview](/docs/reference/whats-new-in-v3). For production use, switch to version 2.5 using the version selector above.

# Introduction to AdCP

Every advertising platform has its own tools, APIs, and workflows. Scaling to more partners means scaling your team — more integrations, more dashboards, more manual coordination. The operational cost of working with 15 platforms is fundamentally different from working with 3.

AdCP (Ad Context Protocol) is an open standard that gives AI agents a shared language for advertising. An agent using AdCP can discover inventory, buy media, build creatives, activate audiences, verify AI provenance, enforce brand suitability, resolve brand identity, and manage accounts — across any platform that implements the protocol.

You set the strategy. Agents handle the execution. You approve what matters.

## How it works

AdCP defines **tasks** — discrete advertising operations like `get_products`, `create_media_buy`, or `activate_signal`. Each task has a JSON Schema-defined request and response. Agents call tasks through two transport protocols:

- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** — Direct integration with AI assistants. An MCP server exposes AdCP tasks as tools that any MCP-compatible client can call.
- **A2A (Agent-to-Agent Protocol)** — Multi-agent workflows where specialized agents (media buying, creative, signals) collaborate on complex campaigns.

The same task definitions work over both transports. Build once, serve both.

## Protocol domains

AdCP v3 covers eight domains:

| Domain | What it does | Key tasks | Access |
|--------|-------------|-----------|--------|
| **Accounts** | Commercial identity and billing | `sync_accounts`, `list_accounts` | MCP / A2A |
| **Media Buy** | Inventory discovery and campaign execution | `get_products`, `create_media_buy` | MCP / A2A |
| **Creative** | Creative generation, catalogs, and AI provenance | `build_creative`, `sync_creatives`, `sync_catalogs` | MCP / A2A |
| **Signals** | Audience and targeting data | `get_signals`, `activate_signal` | MCP / A2A |
| **Governance** | Brand suitability, compliance, and provenance verification | `create_property_list`, `calibrate_content` | MCP / A2A |
| **Sponsored Intelligence** | Conversational brand experiences | `si_initiate_session`, `si_send_message` | MCP / A2A |
| **Brand Protocol** | Brand identity and discovery | `brand.json` resolution | HTTP / MCP |
| **Registry** | Entity resolution and agent discovery | `/api/brands/resolve`, `/api/registry/agents` | REST API |

These domains work together. A typical workflow: resolve a brand via **Brand Protocol**, establish billing via **Accounts**, discover inventory via **Media Buy**, find audiences via **Signals**, check brand suitability via **Governance**, build ads via **Creative**, and execute across platforms.

## Examples

### Discover and buy media

> "Find premium video inventory on sports publishers for a Q2 campaign with a $50,000 budget."

The agent discovers products from connected sales agents, evaluates proposals with delivery forecasts, applies governance property lists to filter for brand-suitable inventory, and creates a media buy — all through standard AdCP tasks.

### Activate audience signals

> "Find high-intent athletic footwear audiences and activate them for our campaign."

The agent queries connected signals agents with a natural language brief, evaluates pricing options, and activates chosen signals on the decisioning platform.

### Generate creatives from brand identity

> "Build display and video creatives for our new trail running shoe using our brand guidelines and product catalog."

The agent resolves brand identity via `brand.json`, retrieves brand assets (logos, colors, tone), discovers available formats from creative agents, syncs the product catalog, and generates on-brand creatives.

### Engage users conversationally

> "A user in our AI assistant is asking about running shoes. Connect them with the brand's agent for a personalized experience."

The host initiates a Sponsored Intelligence session. The brand agent engages conversationally with product recommendations and UI components, and the session can hand off to commerce checkout.

### Verify AI creative compliance

> "Check that all creatives for our campaign carry valid provenance metadata and meet EU AI Act disclosure requirements before they go live."

The agent evaluates provenance claims on each creative via `get_creative_features`, checks for required disclosure positions and jurisdictions against the brief's compliance requirements, and flags gaps before the campaign launches. Governance agents can independently verify AI content claims using third-party detection services.

## For platform providers

AI is buying ads. Make sure it can buy yours.

If you operate a DSP, SSP, publisher, data platform, creative platform, governance service, or any ad tech solution, AdCP lets AI agents discover and transact with your platform. To get started:

1. **Implement an AdCP agent** — Expose your platform's capabilities as AdCP tasks over MCP or A2A. Start with `get_adcp_capabilities`.
2. **Publish your adagents.json** — Declare your properties and authorized agents so buyers can discover you.
3. **Test your implementation** — Validate with [Addie](https://adcontextprotocol.org/chat), the [client SDKs](/docs/building/schemas-and-sdks), or the [CLI](/docs/quickstart).

Implement the protocol domains relevant to your business:
- **Publishers and SSPs**: [Media Buy](/docs/media-buy) and [adagents.json](/docs/governance/property)
- **Data providers**: [Signals](/docs/signals/overview) and [data provider guide](/docs/signals/data-providers)
- **Creative platforms**: [Creative](/docs/creative)
- **Governance vendors**: [Governance protocol](/docs/governance/overview)
- **Brands**: [Brand Protocol](/docs/brand-protocol) and [brand.json](/docs/brand-protocol/brand-json)

## For advertisers and agencies

Run campaigns across more platforms without scaling your team.

AdCP-enabled agents work across all your media partners through a single interface — the same tasks buy CTV inventory, activate audience data, and manage creatives regardless of which platform you're working with.

1. **Check platform support** — See which of your media partners support AdCP, or browse the [registry](/docs/registry).
2. **Try it with Addie** — [Ask Addie](https://adcontextprotocol.org/chat) to walk you through the protocol — no code required.
3. **Connect with your team** — Share the [quickstart guide](/docs/quickstart) with your technical team to integrate client libraries.
