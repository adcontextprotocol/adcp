# Signals Protocol

The Signals Protocol enables AI agents to discover, activate, and manage data signals for advertising campaigns. Signals represent targetable audiences, contextual categories, geographic regions, and other data attributes.

## What Are Signals?

Signals are data segments that can be used for targeting or measurement in advertising campaigns. They include:

- **Audience Signals**: User segments based on demographics, interests, or behaviors
- **Contextual Signals**: Content categories or page contexts
- **Geographic Signals**: Location-based targeting data
- **Temporal Signals**: Time-based targeting patterns
- **Multi-dimensional Signals**: Combined or custom signal types

## Key Capabilities

The Signals Protocol provides:

- Natural language signal discovery based on marketing objectives
- Multi-platform signal discovery in a single request
- Signal activation for specific platforms and accounts
- Transparent pricing with CPM and percent-of-media models (including CPM caps)
- Campaign usage reporting for post-delivery settlement

## Tasks

The Signals Protocol has two protocol-specific tasks. Transaction reporting uses the generic [account management tasks](/docs/building/integration/account-state) shared across all vendor protocols.

| Task | Domain | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| [`get_signals`](/docs/signals/tasks/get_signals) | signals | Discover signals with pricing options |
| [`activate_signal`](/docs/signals/tasks/activate_signal) | signals | Activate a custom signal for use in campaigns |
| [`report_usage`](/docs/building/integration/account-state) | account | Report how signal data was used after delivery |

## Transaction Model

The standard signal transaction flow:

1. **`sync_accounts`** — Establish the commercial relationship with the signals agent, receiving an `account_id` and billing terms.
2. **`get_signals`** — Discover signals. Pass `account_id` and `buyer_campaign_ref` to receive per-account pricing options. Each signal returns `pricing_options[]`, each with a `pricing_option_id` and rate.
3. **Campaign runs** — Use the signals via the platform's standard targeting interface.
4. **`report_usage`** — Report actual consumption (impressions, media spend, vendor cost) referencing the `signal_agent_segment_id` and `pricing_option_id` chosen at discovery time.

`activate_signal` is for custom signals that require explicit DSP-side activation (e.g., audience lists that need to be pushed to a specific platform before use).

## Getting Started

1. **Discover signals** using `get_signals` with a natural language brief and your `account_id`
2. **Review pricing options** and signal sizes in the response
3. **Use in campaigns** via the platform's standard targeting interface
4. **Report usage** using `report_usage` after delivery

See the [Protocol Specification](/docs/signals/specification) for complete technical details.
