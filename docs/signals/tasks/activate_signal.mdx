title: activate_signal
---


**Task**: Activate a signal for use on a specific platform/account.

**Response Time**: Minutes to days (asynchronous with potential human-in-the-loop)

**Request Schema**: [`https://adcontextprotocol.org/schemas/v2/signals/activate-signal-request.json`](https://adcontextprotocol.org/schemas/v2/signals/activate-signal-request.json)
**Response Schema**: [`https://adcontextprotocol.org/schemas/v2/signals/activate-signal-response.json`](https://adcontextprotocol.org/schemas/v2/signals/activate-signal-response.json)

The `activate_signal` task handles the entire activation lifecycle, including:
- Initiating the activation request
- Monitoring activation progress
- Returning the final deployment status

## Request Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `signal_agent_segment_id` | string | Yes | The universal identifier for the signal to activate |
| `deployments` | Destination[] | Yes | Target deployment(s) for activation (see Destination Object below) |

### Destination Object

Each deployment target uses a `type` field to discriminate between platform-based and agent-based deployments:

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `type` | string | Yes | Discriminator: "platform" for DSPs, "agent" for sales agents |
| `platform` | string | Conditional* | Platform identifier (e.g., 'the-trade-desk', 'amazon-dsp'). Required when type="platform" |
| `agent_url` | string (URI) | Conditional* | URL identifying the sales agent. Required when type="agent" |
| `account` | string | No | Account identifier on the platform or agent |

*`platform` is required when `type="platform"`, `agent_url` is required when `type="agent"`.

**Activation Keys**: If the authenticated caller has access to any of the deployment targets in the request, the signal agent will include `activation_key` in the response for those deployments.

**Permission Model**: The signal agent determines key inclusion based on the caller's authentication and authorization. For example:
- A sales agent receives keys for deployments matching its `agent_url`
- A buyer with credentials for multiple DSP platforms receives keys for all those deployments
- Access is determined by the signal agent's permission system, not by flags in the request

## Response Structure

All AdCP responses include:
- **message**: Human-readable summary of the activation status
- **context_id**: Session continuity identifier for tracking progress
- **data**: Task-specific payload (see Response Data below)

The response structure is identical across protocols, with only the transport wrapper differing:
- **MCP**: Returns complete response as flat JSON  
- **A2A**: Returns as artifacts with message in text part, data in data part

For asynchronous operations like activation, both protocols support:
- **Status tracking**: Check completion status via task_id
- **Progress updates**: Real-time updates on activation progress

### Activation Key Object

The activation key represents how to use the signal on a deployment target. It can be either a segment ID or a key-value pair:

**Segment ID format (typical for DSP platforms):**
```json
{
  "type": "segment_id",
  "segment_id": "ttd_segment_12345"
}
```

**Key-Value format (typical for sales agents):**
```json
{
  "type": "key_value",
  "key": "audience_segment",
  "value": "luxury_auto_intenders"
}
```

## Protocol-Specific Examples

The AdCP payload is identical across protocols. Only the request/response wrapper differs.

### MCP Request - Sales Agent Activation
```json
{
  "tool": "activate_signal",
  "arguments": {
    "signal_agent_segment_id": "luxury_auto_intenders",
    "deployments": [{

}
```

### MCP Response - Synchronous (Key-Value)
Immediate response with activation key:
```json
{
  "message": "Signal successfully activated on Wonderstruck sales agent",
  "context_id": "ctx-signals-123",
  "deployments": [{
    "type": "agent",
    "agent_url": "https://wonderstruck.salesagents.com",

  }]
}
```

### MCP Request - DSP Platform Activation
```json
{
  "tool": "activate_signal",
  "arguments": {
    "signal_agent_segment_id": "luxury_auto_intenders",
    "deployments": [{
      "type": "platform",
      "platform": "the-trade-desk",
      "account": "agency-123-ttd"
    }]
  }
}
```

### MCP Response - Asynchronous (Segment ID)
Initial response:
```json
{
  "message": "Initiating activation of 'Luxury Auto Intenders' on The Trade Desk",
  "context_id": "ctx-signals-123",
  "deployments": [{
    "type": "platform",
    "platform": "the-trade-desk",
    "account": "agency-123-ttd",
    "is_live": false,
    "estimated_activation_duration_minutes": 30
  }]
}
```

After polling for completion:
```json
{
  "message": "Signal successfully activated on The Trade Desk",
  "context_id": "ctx-signals-123",
  "deployments": [{
    "type": "platform",
    "platform": "the-trade-desk",
    "account": "agency-123-ttd",
    "is_live": true,
    "activation_key": {
      "type": "segment_id",
      "segment_id": "ttd_agency123_lux_auto"
    },
    "deployed_at": "2025-01-15T14:30:00Z"
  }]
}
```

### A2A Request

#### Natural Language Invocation
```javascript
await a2a.send({
  message: {
    parts: [{
      kind: "text",
      text: "Please activate the luxury_auto_intenders signal on The Trade Desk for account agency-123-ttd."
    }]
  }
});
```

#### Explicit Skill Invocation
```javascript
await a2a.send({
  message: {
    parts: [{
      kind: "data",
      data: {
        skill: "activate_signal",
        parameters: {
          signal_agent_segment_id: "luxury_auto_intenders",
          deployments: [{
            type: "platform",
            platform: "the-trade-desk",
            account: "agency-123-ttd"
          }]
        }
      }
    }]
  }
});
```

### A2A Response (with streaming)
Initial response:
```json
{
  "taskId": "task-signal-001",
  "status": { "state": "working" }
}
```

Then via Server-Sent Events:
```
data: {"message": "Validating signal access permissions..."}
data: {"message": "Configuring deployment on The Trade Desk..."}
data: {"message": "Finalizing activation..."}
data: {"status": {"state": "completed"}, "artifacts": [{
  "artifactId": "artifact-signal-activation-abc123",
  "name": "signal_activation_result",
  "parts": [
    {"kind": "text", "text": "Signal successfully activated on The Trade Desk"},
    {"kind": "data", "data": {
      "context_id": "ctx-signals-123",
      "deployments": [{
        "type": "platform",
        "platform": "the-trade-desk",
        "account": "agency-123-ttd",
        "activation_key": {
          "type": "segment_id",
          "segment_id": "ttd_agency123_lux_auto"
        },
        "deployed_at": "2025-01-15T14:30:00Z"
      }]
    }}
  ]
}]}
```

### Protocol Transport
- **MCP**: Returns task_id for polling-based asynchronous operation tracking or webhook-based push notifications
- **A2A**: Uses Server-Sent Events for real-time progress updates and completion
- **Data Consistency**: Both protocols contain identical AdCP data structures and version information

### Webhook Support

For long-running activations (when initial response is `submitted`), configure a webhook to receive the complete response when activation completes:

```javascript
const response = await session.call('activate_signal',
  {
    signal_agent_segment_id: "luxury_auto_intenders",
    deployments: [{
      type: "platform",
      platform: "the-trade-desk",
      account: "agency-123-ttd"
    }]
  },
  {
    webhook_url: "https://buyer.com/webhooks/adcp/activate_signal/agent_id/op_id",
    webhook_auth: { type: "bearer", credentials: "secret-token" }
  }
);
```

When activation completes, you receive the full `activate_signal` response:

```http
POST /webhooks/adcp/activate_signal/agent_id/op_id HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer secret-token

{
  "deployments": [{
    "type": "platform",
    "platform": "the-trade-desk",
    "account": "agency-123-ttd",
    "activation_key": {
      "type": "segment_id",
      "segment_id": "ttd_agency123_lux_auto"
    },
    "deployed_at": "2025-01-15T14:30:00Z"
  }]
}
```

See **[Webhooks](/docs/building/implementation/webhooks)** for complete details on webhook configuration and reliability.

      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Error Codes

### Activation Errors
- `SIGNAL_AGENT_SEGMENT_NOT_FOUND`: Signal agent segment ID doesn't exist
- `ACTIVATION_FAILED`: Could not activate signal for unspecified reasons
- `ALREADY_ACTIVATED`: Signal already active on the specified platform/account
- `DEPLOYMENT_UNAUTHORIZED`: Can't deploy to platform/account due to permissions
- `INVALID_PRICING_MODEL`: Requested pricing model not available for this signal

### Configuration Warnings
- `SUBOPTIMAL_CONFIGURATION`: Signal activated but account settings may impact performance
- `SLOW_ACTIVATION`: Activation taking longer than expected but still in progress
- `FREQUENCY_CAP_RESTRICTIVE`: Signal activated but account frequency caps may reduce performance

## Error Handling Philosophy

### Status vs Errors
- **Task Status**: Indicates overall activation outcome (`deployed`, `failed`, etc.)
- **Errors Array**: Contains specific issues, warnings, and remediation steps
- **Partial Success**: Signal can be `deployed` while still having warnings in `errors` array

### Error Types
- **Fatal Errors**: Prevent activation (status = `failed`)
- **Warnings**: Signal activates successfully but with caveats (status = `deployed` + errors)
- **Configuration Issues**: Non-blocking problems that affect performance

## Usage Notes

1. **Account-Specific**: Include the `account` parameter for account-specific activations
2. **Platform-Wide**: Omit the `account` parameter for platform-wide activations
3. **Async Operation**: This is a long-running task that provides status updates
4. **Monitoring**: Use task ID to monitor progress via polling or SSE
5. **Idempotent**: Safe to retry if activation fails

## Implementation Guide

### Generating Activation Messages

The `message` field should provide clear status updates and actionable information:

```python
def generate_activation_message(status, signal_info, request):
    if status == "pending":
        return f"I've initiated activation of '{signal_info.name}' on {request.platform} for account {request.account}. This typically takes about {signal_info.estimated_duration} minutes. I'll monitor the progress and notify you when it's ready to use."
    
    elif status == "processing":
        progress_details = get_progress_details()
        time_remaining = calculate_time_remaining()
        return f"Good progress on the activation. {progress_details}. About {time_remaining} minutes remaining."
    
    elif status == "deployed":
        actual_duration = calculate_actual_duration()
        timing_note = "faster than expected" if actual_duration < signal_info.estimated_duration else "as expected"
        return f"Excellent! The '{signal_info.name}' signal is now live on {request.platform}. You can start using it immediately in your campaigns with the ID '{signal_info.platform_id}'. The activation completed {timing_note} - just {actual_duration} minutes."
    
    elif status == "failed":
        error_explanation = explain_error_in_context(error_code)
        next_steps = get_remediation_steps(error_code)
        return f"I couldn't activate the signal on {request.platform}. {error_explanation}. {next_steps}"
```
