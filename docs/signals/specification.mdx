# Signals Activation Protocol RFC

**Status**: Request for Comments  
**Last Updated**: July 25, 2025

## Abstract

The Signals Activation Protocol defines a standard Model Context Protocol (MCP) interface for AI-powered signal discovery, activation, and management systems. This protocol enables AI assistants to help marketers discover, activate, and manage data signals (audiences, contextual, geographical, temporal, and multi-dimensional data) through natural language interactions.

## Overview

The Signals Activation Protocol provides:

- Natural language signal discovery based on marketing objectives
- Multi-platform signal discovery in a single request
- Signal activation for specific platforms and accounts
- Transparent pricing with CPM and revenue share models
- Signal size reporting with unit types (individuals, devices, households)
- Support for diverse signal types beyond traditional audiences

## Core Concepts

### Agent Integration

The Signals Activation Protocol operates within the broader [AdCP Ecosystem Layers](../intro#the-adcp-ecosystem-layers), enabling signal agents to directly integrate with and activate signals on decisioning platforms (DSPs, orchestration platforms). 

**Direct Integration Model**: Signal agents contract directly with decisioning platforms, eliminating intermediary reporting and usage tracking. Once signals are activated on a decisioning platform, all usage reporting, billing, and campaign metrics are handled directly by that platform.

### Request Roles and Relationships

Every signal discovery request involves two key roles:

#### Orchestrator
The platform or system making the API request to the signal platform:
- **Examples**: Scope3, Claude AI assistant, trading desk platform, campaign management tool
- **Responsibilities**: Makes API calls, handles authentication, manages the technical interaction
- **Account**: Has technical credentials and API access to the signal platform

#### Principal  
The entity on whose behalf the request is being made:
- **Examples**: Advertiser (Nike), agency (Omnicom), brand team, media buyer
- **Responsibilities**: Owns the campaign objectives, budget, and business relationship
- **Pricing**: May have negotiated rates, contract terms, or access to private audiences

#### How This Works in Practice

1. **Request Flow**: Orchestrator → Signal Platform (on behalf of Principal) → Decisioning Platform
2. **Authentication**: Orchestrator authenticates with technical credentials
3. **Authorization**: Principal's identity determines available signals and pricing
4. **Activation**: Signals are activated for Principal's account on the decisioning platform
5. **Billing**: Principal is responsible for usage costs and campaign spend

#### Example Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Marketplace Agent with Personalized Catalog (Agency)**
- **Orchestrator**: Claude AI assistant (making API calls)
- **Principal**: Omnicom (agency running campaign for Nike)
- **Signal Agent**: LiveRamp (marketplace agent, Omnicom has account for personalized catalog)
- **Decisioning Platform**: The Trade Desk (where signals will be used)
- **Flow**: Claude (on behalf of Omnicom) → LiveRamp (Omnicom's personalized catalog with negotiated rates and private data) → delivers to Omnicom's account on The Trade Desk

**Scenario 2: Marketplace Agent with Personalized Catalog**  
- **Orchestrator**: Scope3 platform (connecting signals to agents)
- **Principal**: Nike (advertiser setting up their agent)
- **Signal Agent**: Experian (marketplace agent, Nike has account for personalized catalog)
- **Decisioning Platform**: Nike Advertising Agent (running on Scope3 platform)
- **Flow**: Scope3 (on behalf of Nike) → Experian (Nike's personalized catalog with owned data and custom rates) → delivers to Nike's advertising agent (hosted by Scope3)

**Scenario 3: Private Signal Agent**
- **Orchestrator**: Scope3 platform (connecting signals to agents)
- **Principal**: Walmart (retailer setting up their agent)
- **Signal Agent**: Walmart (private agent, only visible to Walmart)
- **Decisioning Platform**: Walmart Advertising Agent (running on Scope3 platform)
- **Flow**: Scope3 (on behalf of Walmart) → Walmart signal agent (private, owned, no cost) → delivers to Walmart's advertising agent for workflow orchestration

**Scenario 4: Marketplace Agent with Public Catalog**
- **Orchestrator**: Claude AI assistant (making API calls)
- **Principal**: Startup Brand (new advertiser with no existing accounts)
- **Signal Agent**: LiveRamp (marketplace agent, public catalog access)
- **Decisioning Platform**: The Trade Desk (where signals will be used)
- **Flow**: Claude (on behalf of Startup Brand) → LiveRamp (public catalog, standard pricing) → delivers to Startup Brand's account on The Trade Desk

**Scenario 5: Data Provider with Multi-Platform Deployment**
- **Orchestrator**: Agency trading desk platform
- **Principal**: Media Agency (looking for contextual segments)
- **Signal Agent**: Peer39 (contextual data provider)
- **Decisioning Platforms**: Multiple SSPs (Index Exchange, OpenX, PubMatic)
- **Flow**: Trading desk (on behalf of Agency) → Peer39 (returns same segments deployed across multiple SSPs) → Agency can activate on any/all SSPs

### Signal Agent Types

#### Private Signal Agents
Agents owned by the principal with exclusive access:
- **Examples**: Walmart's internal signal platform, retailer first-party data, weather APIs, location providers
- **Business Model**: No signal costs (workflow orchestration only)
- **Access**: Only visible and accessible to the owning principal
- **Discovery**: Not discoverable by other principals
- **Authentication**: Owner-only access, no external visibility
- **Usage Reporting**: Optional (no billing, just workflow tracking)

#### Marketplace Signal Agents  
External agents that license signal data with catalog-based access:
- **Examples**: LiveRamp, Experian, Peer39, weather data providers, location intelligence providers
- **Business Model**: CPM, revenue share, or licensing fees
- **Usage Reporting**: Required for billing reconciliation

**Catalog Access Levels:**
- **Public Catalog**: Available to any orchestrator without principal registration
  - Standard marketplace pricing
  - Platform-wide segments only (available to all decisioning platform users)
  - No account specification needed in requests
  - All segments already live (`scope: "platform-wide"`)
  
- **Personalized Catalog**: Requires principal account with the signal agent
  - All platform-wide segments (same as public catalog)
  - PLUS account-specific segments (custom signals, private data)
  - Mixed pricing: negotiated rates for some, standard rates for others
  - Account field required in requests for account-specific deployments

### Authentication Patterns

- **Private**: Owner-only authentication (e.g., Walmart authenticates to their own agent)
- **Marketplace**: Orchestrator authentication determines catalog access level
  - Public catalog: Orchestrator credentials sufficient
  - Personalized catalog: Requires principal account with signal agent

### Segment ID Structure

Signal discovery involves multiple segment identifiers at different stages:

#### Signal Agent Segment ID
The identifier used by the signal agent for their internal segment tracking:
- **Example**: `"polk_001382"` (Polk's segment as known to LiveRamp)
- **Usage**: Used in `get_signals` responses and `activate_signal` requests
- **Scope**: Internal to the signal agent platform

#### Decisioning Platform Segment ID  
The identifier assigned by the decisioning platform after activation:
- **Example**: `"liveramp_polk_dallas_lexus"` (TTD's ID for the activated segment)
- **Usage**: Returned in `activate_signal` responses and used for campaign targeting
- **Scope**: Internal to the decisioning platform
- **Timing**: Only available after successful activation
- **Variability**: May differ by platform and account for the same signal

### Agent vs Data Provider

- **Agent**: The signal platform facilitating access (e.g., LiveRamp, Experian)
- **Data Provider**: The original source of the signal data (e.g., Polk, Acxiom, Peer39, weather services, location providers)

A signal agent may host segments from multiple data providers in their marketplace.

### Coverage Percentage

Coverage percentage indicates what portion of the agent's total addressable population this segment covers:
- **99%**: Matches nearly all identifiers the agent has (very broad signal)
- **50%**: Matches about half the agent's identifiers (medium signal)
- **1%**: Matches very few identifiers the agent has (very niche signal)

This is relative to each signal agent's capabilities - a 50% coverage signal from LiveRamp may be larger than a 99% coverage signal from a niche data provider.

### Pricing Models

- **CPM**: Cost per thousand impressions
- **Revenue Share**: Percentage of media spend
- **Both**: Some signals offer choice between models
- **Included**: No additional cost (e.g., with media buys)

## Tasks

The Signals Activation Protocol defines the following tasks that agents can perform:

### [get_signals](./tasks/get_signals.mdx)

Discover relevant signals based on a marketing specification across multiple platforms. This task enables natural language search for audiences, contextual signals, and other targeting data.

### [activate_signal](./tasks/activate_signal.mdx)

Activate a signal for use on a specific platform/account. This task handles the entire activation lifecycle, including initiating the request, monitoring progress, and returning the final deployment status.



## Typical Flow

### Data Provider Multi-Platform Flow (e.g., Peer39)

1. **Discovery**: Call `get_signals` with multiple platforms to see all deployments at once

2. **Review**: See which platforms have signals live vs. requiring activation, compare segment IDs across platforms

3. **Select**: Choose which platforms to use based on campaign needs and existing deployments

4. **Activate**: For any platforms where signals aren't live, call `activate_signal`

5. **Launch**: Run campaigns across multiple SSPs using the platform-specific segment IDs

6. **Report**: Report usage separately for each platform where the signal was used

### Marketplace Signal Agent Flow

1. **Discovery**: Call `get_signals` multiple times to explore different signal options - response varies by authentication (public vs personalized catalog)

2. **Review**: Evaluate signal options, pricing, and `deployment.is_live` status for the specific decisioning platform

3. **Commit**: Principal decides to proceed with specific signals for their media execution

4. **Activate**: For account-specific segments that aren't live, call `activate_signal` to deploy from signal agent to decisioning platform (the task handles monitoring progress automatically)

5. **Launch**: Once deployed, launch the media execution (campaigns, PMPs, direct buys, etc.) on the decisioning platform using the activated signals


### Private Signal Agent Flow

1. **Discovery**: Call `get_signals` on owned signal agent (Walmart), with no licensing costs

2. **Review**: Check `deployment.is_live` status for workflow orchestration (no pricing review needed)

3. **Commit**: Principal decides to proceed with owned signals for their media execution

4. **Activate**: If not live, call `activate_signal` for workflow orchestration from owned agent to decisioning platform (the task handles monitoring progress automatically)

5. **Launch**: Once deployed, launch the media execution using owned signals


## Error Codes

- `SIGNAL_AGENT_SEGMENT_NOT_FOUND`: Signal agent segment ID doesn't exist
- `ACTIVATION_FAILED`: Could not activate signal
- `ALREADY_ACTIVATED`: Signal already active
- `DEPLOYMENT_UNAUTHORIZED`: Can't deploy to platform/account
- `INVALID_PRICING_MODEL`: Pricing model not available
- `AGENT_NOT_FOUND`: Private signal agent not visible to this principal
- `AGENT_ACCESS_DENIED`: Principal not authorized for this signal agent

## Error Handling

For comprehensive error handling guidance including pending vs error states, response patterns, and recovery strategies, see [Protocol Error Handling](../protocols/error-handling.mdx).

Signal-specific error codes are documented in each task specification and the [Error Codes Reference](../reference/error-codes.mdx).

## Response Structure

All AdCP Signals responses follow a consistent structure across both MCP and A2A protocols:

### Core Response Fields
- **message**: Human-readable summary of the operation result
- **context_id**: Session continuity identifier for follow-up requests
- **data**: Task-specific payload (varies by task)

### Protocol Transport
- **MCP**: Returns complete response as flat JSON object
- **A2A**: Returns as structured artifacts with message in text part, data in data part
- **Data Consistency**: Both protocols contain identical AdCP data structures and version information

### Asynchronous Operations
Some operations (like signal activation) are asynchronous and include:
- **task_id**: Unique identifier for tracking operation progress
- **status**: Current operation status (pending, processing, deployed, failed)
- **estimated_duration**: Time estimates for pending operations

## Implementation Notes

### Authentication

Each MCP session involves two levels of identification:

#### Orchestrator Authentication
The technical credentials used by the orchestrator to authenticate with the signal platform:
- **API Keys**: Technical access credentials for the orchestrator platform
- **Session Scope**: Determines what operations the orchestrator can perform
- **Platform Permissions**: What signal platforms the orchestrator can access

#### Principal Authorization  
The principal's identity determines business-level access and pricing:
- **Account Relationship**: Whether the principal has a direct relationship with the signal platform
- **Pricing Tier**: Negotiated rates, marketplace rates, or enterprise discounts
- **Signal Access**: Private signals, premium segments, or marketplace-only access
- **Billing Account**: Where usage charges are applied

#### Authentication Flow
1. **Caller** authenticates with signal agent using their credentials
2. **Signal agent** determines catalog access level based on authentication
3. **Responses** reflect the authenticated party's available options and rates

### Orchestrator Implementation Guidelines

#### Agent Discovery and Access
1. **Private Agents**: Only show to owning principal (e.g., only show Walmart's agent to Walmart)
2. **Marketplace Agents**: Always discoverable, but catalog access varies by principal account status

#### Error Handling by Agent Type
- **Private**: Return `AGENT_NOT_FOUND` for non-owners
- **Marketplace**: Always allow requests but return appropriate catalog level
  - Public catalog: Generic marketplace offerings with standard pricing
  - Personalized catalog: Principal's custom data, negotiated rates, and owned segments

#### User Experience Considerations
- **Setup Flow**: Marketplace agents with public catalogs enable immediate signal discovery
- **Account Benefits**: Principals with marketplace agent accounts get their own data plus negotiated rates
- **Privacy**: Private agents ensure data sovereignty for owned signals

### Multi-Platform Considerations

#### Response Format
- All responses contain `deployments` array showing signal availability across platforms
- Enables efficient multi-platform discovery and activation planning

#### Platform-Specific Segment IDs
- Same signal may have different segment IDs on different platforms
- Account-specific deployments may have different IDs than platform-wide deployments
- Always use the correct `decisioning_platform_segment_id` for each platform/account combination

#### Efficient Discovery
- Data providers like Peer39 can return all their deployments in one response
- Reduces API calls from N (one per platform) to 1
- Particularly valuable for contextual data providers with wide SSP distribution

### Best Practices

1. **Status Checking**: Always check `is_live` status before attempting activation
2. **Activation Timing**: Allow appropriate time for signal activation (typically 1-2 hours, up to 24-48 hours for complex deployments)
3. **Size Understanding**: Understand the difference between individuals, devices, and households in coverage metrics
4. **Pricing Flexibility**: Consider both CPM and revenue share pricing options when available
5. **Multi-Platform Efficiency**: Use multi-platform queries when discovering signals across data providers to reduce API calls
6. **Campaign Integration**: Store platform-specific segment IDs for use in campaign targeting
7. **Asynchronous Handling**: Implement proper task monitoring for activation operations using task_id tracking
8. **Context Continuity**: Use context_id for session management across related signal operations
