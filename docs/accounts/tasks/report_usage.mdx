title: report_usage
testable: false
---

Reports how a vendor's service was consumed after campaign delivery. Called by orchestrators to inform a vendor agent (signals, governance, creative) what was used so the vendor can track earned revenue and verify billing.

Each usage record is self-contained — it carries its own `account` and `buyer_campaign_ref`. A single request can span multiple accounts and campaigns.

**Response Time**: ~1s.

**Request Schema**: [`/schemas/v3/account/report-usage-request.json`](https://adcontextprotocol.org/schemas/v3/account/report-usage-request.json)
**Response Schema**: [`/schemas/v3/account/report-usage-response.json`](https://adcontextprotocol.org/schemas/v3/account/report-usage-response.json)

## Request Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `reporting_period` | object | Yes | `start` and `end` as ISO 8601 date-time in UTC. Applies to all records in the request. |
| `usage` | UsageRecord[] | Yes | One or more usage records. |

### Usage Record Fields

Each record requires `account`, `vendor_cost`, and `currency`. Additional fields depend on the vendor type:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `account` | [AccountRef](/docs/building/integration/accounts-and-agents#account-references) | Yes | Account for this record — by `account_id` or `{ brand, operator }`. |
| `vendor_cost` | number | Yes | Amount owed to the vendor for this record, in `currency` |
| `currency` | string | Yes | ISO 4217 currency code |
| `pricing_option_id` | string | Signals: Yes | Pricing option from the vendor's discovery response. The vendor uses this to verify the correct rate was applied. |
| `buyer_campaign_ref` | string | No | Buyer's campaign reference (e.g., a `media_buy_id`). Used to group records by campaign. |
| `impressions` | number | Signals: Yes | Impressions delivered |
| `media_spend` | number | percent_of_media: Yes | Media spend for percent-of-media cost verification |
| `signal_agent_segment_id` | string | Signals: Yes | Signal identifier from `get_signals` |

## Response

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `accepted` | Number of usage records successfully stored |
| `errors` | Validation errors for individual records. Partial acceptance is valid — accepted records are stored even when some fail. |

## Examples

### Signal usage — single campaign

    "end": "2025-03-31T23:59:59Z"
  },
  "usage": [
    {
      "account": { "account_id": "acct_pinnacle_signals" },
      "buyer_campaign_ref": "mb_spring_launch_001",
      "signal_agent_segment_id": "luxury_auto_intenders",
      "pricing_option_id": "po_lux_auto_cpm",

      "vendor_cost": 2100.00,
      "currency": "USD"
    }
  ]
}
```

```json Response
{
  "accepted": 1
}
```

</CodeGroup>

### Multi-account batch

A single request spanning two campaigns across two accounts:

```json
{
  "reporting_period": {
    "start": "2025-03-01T00:00:00Z",
    "end": "2025-03-31T23:59:59Z"
  },
  "usage": [
    {
      "account": { "account_id": "acct_pinnacle_signals" },
      "buyer_campaign_ref": "mb_spring_q1_001",
      "signal_agent_segment_id": "luxury_auto_intenders",
      "pricing_option_id": "po_lux_auto_cpm",
      "impressions": 2100000,
      "vendor_cost": 1050.00,
      "currency": "USD"
    },
    {
      "account": { "account_id": "acct_nova" },
      "buyer_campaign_ref": "mb_summer_preview_002",
      "signal_agent_segment_id": "eco_conscious_shoppers",
      "pricing_option_id": "po_eco_cpm",
      "impressions": 800000,
      "vendor_cost": 400.00,
      "currency": "USD"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Partial acceptance

If some records fail validation, the response identifies how many were accepted:

```json
{
  "accepted": 1,
  "errors": [
    {
      "code": "INVALID_PRICING_OPTION",
      "message": "pricing_option_id 'po_unknown' does not exist on this account",
      "field": "usage[1].pricing_option_id"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Reporting cadence

Report at regular intervals — monthly at minimum. For campaigns with significant spend, weekly reporting gives vendor agents timely visibility into earned revenue.

Report upon campaign completion to close out the final period.

## Error Handling

| Error Code | Description | Resolution |
|------------|-------------|------------|
| `ACCOUNT_NOT_FOUND` | Account reference in a usage record not found or not accessible | Verify via `list_accounts`; re-run `sync_accounts` if needed |
| `INVALID_USAGE_DATA` | A usage record has missing or invalid fields | Check required fields for your vendor type |
| `INVALID_PRICING_OPTION` | `pricing_option_id` not found on this account | Verify `pricing_option_id` from the vendor's discovery response |
