      </p>

      <p>
        Building on the October launch of the first technical protocol for agentic advertising, an array of leading marketing services companies today announced the incorporation of AgenticAdvertising.org, an independent nonprofit organization dedicated to advancing standards and practices for agentic AI as shared infrastructure for the advertising ecosystem.
      </p>

      <p>
        The organization arrives as AI fundamentally reshapes how marketing organizations operate, breaking down the silos among creative, media, commerce, technology, and data that have constrained the industry for years. AgenticAdvertising.org will have balanced representation across brands, agencies, publishers, and ad tech to guide the mission, objectives, and principles of the organization.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          "Brands are building agentic capabilities, agencies are reimagining workflows, and publishers are exploring new ways to connect with advertisers. Without shared standards and collaborative development, every integration becomes bespoke and the opportunity to rebuild advertising gets lost to another generation of fragmentation. With shared standards and practices, we can reunite creativity and media, and ignite a revolution in marketing effectiveness."
        </p>
        <cite>Benjamin Masse, Chief Product Officer at Triton Digital, part of iHeartMedia</cite>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Industry veterans Matthew Egol and Randall Rothenberg have been brought in as interim leads to stand up the organization, establishing its mission, governance structure, and strategic direction.
      </p>

      <p>
        AgenticAdvertising.org will provide independent governance for AdCP and related standards, establishing the frameworks, education, and collaborative processes needed to ensure development benefits the entire ecosystem. Beyond standards governance, the organization will provide adoption support, leading practices, certifications, thought leadership, and other services to member organizations and individuals advancing agentic advertising and marketing.
      </p>

      <p>
        Egol is founder and CEO of JourneySpark Consulting, a former partner in the marketing and media practices at Booz & Co. and PwC, and a longtime advisor to brands, publishers, platforms, agencies, and trade bodies. Rothenberg is the former CEO of the IAB, former CMO of Booz & Co., advertising columnist for The New York Times and Advertising Age, and author of the best-selling book <em>Where the Suckers Moon: The Life and Death of an Advertising Campaign</em>.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          "Marketing is entering a period of genuine transformation. When we look back at 2025, we'll recognize this as the year the industry had a choice about how agentic capabilities would develop. You can have fragmentation, where every platform builds proprietary solutions and integration becomes the tax everyone pays. Or you can build toward a shared vision that lets brands, agencies, publishers and other agentic builders and implementers across the ecosystem focus resources on strategy and creativity rather than on plumbing."
        </p>
        <cite>Randall Rothenberg</cite>
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          "Agentic advertising will change the game for companies looking to strengthen a culture of experimentation. It lowers the cost of complexity to integrate across paid and owned media assets and optimize next best content for your customer personas."
        </p>
        <cite>Matthew Egol</cite>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        The formation of AgenticAdvertising.org follows the launch of AdCP, the first open standard enabling interoperable agent-to-agent communication across the advertising ecosystem, which has drawn thousands of participants and more than 1,200 engaged community members. As the broader agentic landscape evolves, AgenticAdvertising.org is committed to collaborating openly with other standards and practices bodies, ensuring advertising-specific standards can both flourish independently and complement wider agentic frameworks emerging across industries.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          "As autonomous systems reshape how digital advertising is planned, executed, and measured, the industry needs shared foundations that ensure these capabilities scale responsibly. Agentic advertising will not be a black box. Open standards like AdCP are essential to delivering transparency, interoperability, and verifiable performance and the architectural principles that define the next era of our industry."
        </p>
        <cite>Rajeev Goel, Co-Founder and CEO of PubMatic</cite>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Agentic advertising represents a fundamental shift from programmatic automation to intelligent agent collaboration. Unlike previous waves of ad tech innovation that created fragmented solutions and walled gardens, this movement has the opportunity to establish open standards, transparent practices, and interoperable systems from the outset.
      </p>

      <p>
        During their tenure as interim leaders, Egol and Rothenberg will engage brand CMOs, agency executives, and publishers to understand priorities across the ecosystem. The organization's permanent governance structure and board leadership will be announced in early 2026, followed by a flagship industry event in April.
