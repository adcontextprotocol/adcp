### Changed

- Initial release, no changes from previous versions

### Design Decisions

- **Simplified Versioning**: Version is maintained only in the schema registry (`/schemas/v1/index.json`) and indicated by schema path. Individual request/response schemas and documentation do not contain version fields, reducing maintenance burden while maintaining clear version semantics.

### Technical Details

- **Schema Version**: 1.0.0
- **Standard Formats Version**: 1.0.0
- **Protocol Support**: MCP, A2A
- **Node Version**: >=18.0

### Notes

This is the first stable release of AdCP, marking it as production-ready. Future releases will follow semantic versioning:
- **Patch versions** (1.0.x): Bug fixes and clarifications
- **Minor versions** (1.x.0): New features and enhancements (backward compatible)
- **Major versions** (x.0.0): Breaking changes

We use [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) for version management. All changes should include a changeset file.
