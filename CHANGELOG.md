# Changelog

## 2.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 67471e1: - Standardize webhook payload: protocol envelope at top-level; task-specific data moved under result.
  - Result schema is bound to task_type via JSON Schema refs; result may be present for any status (including failed).
  - Error remains a string; can appear alongside result.
  - Required fields updated to: task_id, task_type, status, timestamp. Domain is no longer required.
  - Docs updated to reflect envelope + result model.
  - Compatibility: non-breaking for users of adcp/client (already expects result); breaking for direct webhook consumers that parsed task fields at the root.

### Patch Changes

- b09ddd6: Update homepage documentation links to external docs site. All documentation links on the homepage, navigation, and footer now point to https://docs.adcontextprotocol.org instead of local paths, directing users to the hosted documentation site.

## 2.3.0

### Minor Changes

- da956ff: Restructure property references across the protocol to use `publisher_properties` pattern. Publishers are the single source of truth for property definitions.

  **Architecture Change: Publishers Own Property Definitions**

  `list_authorized_properties` now works like IAB Tech Lab's sellers.json - it lists which publishers an agent represents. Buyers fetch each publisher's adagents.json to see property definitions and verify authorization scope.

  **Key Changes:**

  1. **list_authorized_properties response** - Simplified to just domains:

  ```json
  // Before (v2.x)
  {"properties": [{...}], "tags": {...}}

  // After (v2.3)
  {"publisher_domains": ["cnn.com", "espn.com"]}
  ```

  2. **Product property references** - Changed to publisher_properties:

  ```json
  // Before (v2.x)
  {
    "properties": [{...full objects...}]
    // OR
    "property_tags": ["premium"]
  }

  // After (v2.3)
  {
    "publisher_properties": [
      {
        "publisher_domain": "cnn.com",
        "property_tags": ["ctv"]
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

  Buyers fetch `https://cnn.com/.well-known/adagents.json` for:

  - Property definitions (cnn.com is source of truth)
  - Agent authorization verification
  - Property tag definitions

  **New Fields:**

  1. **`contact`** _(optional)_ - Identifies who manages this file (publisher or third-party):

     - `name` - Entity managing the file (e.g., "Meta Advertising Operations")
     - `email` - Contact email for questions/issues
     - `domain` - Primary domain of managing entity
     - `seller_id` - Seller ID from IAB Tech Lab sellers.json
     - `tag_id` - TAG Certified Against Fraud ID

  2. **`properties`** _(optional)_ - Top-level property list (same structure as `list_authorized_properties`):

     - Array of Property objects with identifiers and tags
     - Defines all properties covered by this file

  3. **`tags`** _(optional)_ - Property tag metadata (same structure as `list_authorized_properties`):

     - Human-readable names and descriptions for each tag

  4. **Agent Authorization** - Four patterns for scoping:

     - `property_ids` - Direct property ID references within this file
     - `property_tags` - Tag-based authorization within this file
     - `properties` - Explicit property lists (inline definitions)
     - `publisher_properties` - **Recommended for third-party agents**: Reference properties from publisher's canonical adagents.json files
     - If all omitted, agent is authorized for all properties in file

  5. **Property IDs** - Optional `property_id` field on Property objects:

     - Enables direct referencing (`"property_ids": ["cnn_ctv_app"]`)
     - Recommended format: lowercase with underscores
     - More efficient than repeating full property objects

  6. **publisher_domain Optional** - Now optional in adagents.json:
     - Required in `list_authorized_properties` (multi-domain responses)
     - Optional in adagents.json (file location implies domain)

  **Benefits:**

  - **Single source of truth**: Publishers define properties once in their own adagents.json
  - **No duplication**: Agents don't copy property data, they reference it
  - **Automatic updates**: Agent authorization reflects publisher property changes without manual sync
  - **Simpler agents**: Agents return authorization list, not property details
  - **Buyer validation**: Buyers verify authorization by checking publisher's adagents.json
  - **Scalability**: Works for agents representing 1 or 1000 publishers

  **Use Cases:**

  - **Third-Party Sales Networks**: CTV specialist represents multiple publishers without duplicating property data
  - **Publisher Direct**: Publisher's own agent references their domain, buyers fetch properties from publisher file
  - **Meta Multi-Brand**: Single agent for Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp using property tags
  - **Tumblr Subdomain Control**: Authorize root domain only, NOT user subdomains
  - **Authorization Validation**: Buyers verify agent is in publisher's authorized_agents list

  **Domain Matching Rules:**

  Follows web conventions while requiring explicit authorization for non-standard subdomains:

  - `"example.com"` → Matches base domain + www + m (standard web/mobile subdomains)
  - `"edition.example.com"` → Matches only that specific subdomain
  - `"*.example.com"` → Matches ALL subdomains but NOT base domain

  **Rationale**: www and m are conventionally the same site. Other subdomains require explicit listing.

  **Migration Guide:**

  Sales agents need to update `list_authorized_properties` implementation:

  **Old approach (v2.x)**:

  1. Fetch/maintain full property definitions
  2. Return complete property objects in response
  3. Keep property data synchronized with publishers

  **New approach (v2.3+)**:

  1. Read `publisher_properties` from own adagents.json
  2. Extract unique publisher domains
  3. Return just the list of publisher domains
  4. No need to maintain property data - buyers fetch from publishers

  Buyer agents need to update workflow:

  1. Call `list_authorized_properties` to get publisher domain list
  2. Fetch each publisher's adagents.json
  3. Find agent in publisher's authorized_agents array
  4. Resolve authorization scope from publisher's file (property_ids, property_tags, or all)
  5. Cache publisher properties for product validation

  **Backward Compatibility:** Response structure changed but this is pre-1.0, so treated as minor version. `adagents.json` changes are additive (new optional fields).

- bf0987c: Make brand_manifest optional in get_products and remove promoted_offering.

  Sales agents can now decide whether brand context is necessary for product recommendations. This allows for more flexible product discovery workflows where brand information may not always be available or required upfront.

  **Schema changes:**

  - `get-products-request.json`: Removed `brand_manifest` from required fields array

  **Documentation changes:**

  - Removed all references to `promoted_offering` field (which never existed in schema)
  - Updated all request examples to remove `promoted_offering`
  - Updated usage notes and implementation guide to focus on `brief` and `brand_manifest`
  - Removed policy checking guidance that was tied to `promoted_offering`
  - Fixed schema-documentation mismatch where docs showed `promoted_offering` but schema had `brand_manifest`

- ff4af78: Add placement targeting for creative assignments. Enables products to define multiple placements (e.g., homepage banner, article sidebar) and buyers to assign different creatives to each placement while purchasing the entire product.

  **New schemas:**

  - `placement.json` - Placement definition with placement_id, name, description, format_ids
  - Added optional `placements` array to Product schema
  - Added optional `placement_ids` array to CreativeAssignment schema

  **Design:**

  - Packages always buy entire products (no package-level placement targeting)
  - Placement targeting only via `create_media_buy`/`update_media_buy` creative assignments
  - `sync_creatives` does NOT support placement targeting (keeps bulk operations simple)
  - Creatives without `placement_ids` run on all placements in the product

- 04cc3b9: Remove media buy level budget field. Budget is now only specified at the package level, with each package's pricing_option_id determining the currency. This simplifies the protocol by eliminating redundant budget aggregation and allows mixed-currency campaigns when sellers support it.

  **Breaking changes:**

  - Removed `budget` field from create_media_buy request (at media buy level)
  - Removed `budget` field from update_media_buy request (at media buy level)

  **Migration:**

  - Move budget amounts to individual packages
  - Each package specifies budget as a number in the currency of its pricing_option_id
  - Sellers can enforce single-currency rules if needed by validating pricing options

- 7c194f7: Add tracker_script type to URL assets for measurement SDKs. Split the `url_type` enum to distinguish between HTTP request tracking (tracker_pixel) and script tag loading (tracker_script) for OMID verification scripts and native event trackers.

### Patch Changes

- 279ded1: Clarify webhook payload structure with explicit required fields documentation.

  **Changes:**

  - Added new `webhook-payload.json` schema documenting the complete structure of webhook POST payloads
  - Added new `task-type.json` enum schema with all valid AdCP task types
  - Refactored task schemas to use `$ref` to task-type enum (eliminates duplication across 4 schemas)
  - Updated task management documentation to explicitly list required webhook fields: `task_id`, `task_type`, `domain`, `status`, `created_at`, `updated_at`
  - Enhanced webhook examples to show all required protocol-level fields
  - Added schema reference link for webhook payload structure

  **Context:**
  This clarifies an ambiguity in the spec that was causing confusion in implementations. The `task_type` field is required in webhook payloads (along with other protocol-level task metadata) but this wasn't explicitly documented before. Webhooks receive the complete task response object which includes both protocol-level fields AND domain-specific response data merged at the top level.

  **Impact:**

  - Documentation-only change, no breaking changes to existing implementations
  - Helps implementers understand the exact structure of webhook POST payloads
  - Resolves confusion about whether `task_type` is required (it is)

- 21848aa: Switch llms.txt plugin so that we get proper URLs
- 69179a2: Updated LICENSE to Apache2 and introducing CONTRIBUTING.md and IPR_POLICY.md
- cc3b86b: Add comprehensive security documentation including SECURITY.md with vulnerability disclosure policy and enhanced security guidelines covering financial transaction safety, multi-party trust model, authentication/authorization, data protection, compliance considerations, and role-specific security checklists.
- 86d9e9c: Fix URL asset field naming and simplify URL type classification.

  **Schema changes:**

  - Added `url_type` field to URL asset schema (`/schemas/v1/core/assets/url-asset.json`)
  - Simplified `url_type` to two values:
    - `clickthrough` - URL for human interaction (may redirect through ad tech)
    - `tracker` - URL that fires in background (returns pixel/204)

  **Documentation updates:**

  - Replaced all instances of `url_purpose` with `url_type` across all documentation
  - Simplified all tracking URL types (impression_tracker, click_tracker, video_start, video_complete, etc.) to just `tracker`
  - Clarified that `url_type` is only used in format requirements, not in creative manifest payloads
  - The `asset_id` field already indicates the specific purpose (e.g., `impression_tracker`, `video_start_tracker`, `landing_url`)

  **Rationale:**
  The distinction between impression_tracker, click_tracker, video_start, etc. was overly prescriptive. The `asset_id` in format definitions already tells you what the URL is semantically for. The `url_type` field distinguishes between URLs intended for human interaction (clickthrough) versus background tracking (tracker). A clickthrough may redirect through ad tech platforms before reaching the final destination, while a tracker fires in the background and returns a pixel or 204 response.

- 97ec201: Added min_width, min_height and aspect_ratio to ImageAsset type

## 2.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 727463a: Align build_creative with transformation model and consistent naming

  **Breaking changes:**

  - `build_creative` now uses `creative_manifest` instead of `source_manifest` parameter
  - `build_creative` request no longer accepts `promoted_offerings` as a task parameter (must be in manifest assets)
  - `preview_creative` request no longer accepts `promoted_offerings` as a task parameter (must be in manifest assets)
  - `build_creative` response simplified to return just `creative_manifest` (removed complex nested structure)

  **Improvements:**

  - Clear transformation model: manifest-in → manifest-out
  - Format definitions drive requirements (e.g., promoted_offerings is a format asset requirement)
  - Consistent naming across build_creative and preview_creative
  - Self-contained manifests that flow through build → preview → sync
  - Eliminated redundancy and ambiguity about where to provide inputs

  This change makes the creative generation workflow much clearer and more consistent. Generative formats that require `promoted_offerings` should specify it as a required asset in their format definition, and it should be included in the `creative_manifest.assets` object.

### Patch Changes

- eeb9967: Automate schema version synchronization with package.json

  Implemented three-layer protection to ensure schema registry version stays in sync with package.json:

  1. **Auto-staging**: update-schema-versions.js now automatically stages changes to git
  2. **Verification gate**: New verify-version-sync.js script prevents releases when versions don't match
  3. **Pre-push validation**: Git hook checks version sync before any push

  Also fixed v2.1.0 schema registry version (was incorrectly showing 2.0.0) and removed duplicate creative-manifest entry.

- 7d0c8c8: Improve documentation visibility and navigation

  **Documentation Improvements:**

  1. **Added Changelog Page**

     - Created comprehensive `/docs/reference/changelog` with v2.1.0 and v2.0.0 release notes
     - Includes developer migration guide with code examples
     - Documents breaking changes and versioning policy
     - Added to sidebar navigation in Reference section

  2. **Improved Pricing Documentation Visibility**

     - Added Pricing Models to sidebar navigation (Media Buy Protocol > Advanced Topics)
     - Added pricing information callouts to key task documentation
     - Enhanced `get_products` with pricing_options field description
     - Added missing `pricing_option_id` field to `create_media_buy` Package Object
     - Added prominent tip box linking to pricing guide in media-products.md

  3. **Added Release Banner**
     - Homepage now displays v2.1.0 release announcement with link to changelog
     - Makes new releases immediately visible to documentation readers

  **Why These Changes:**

  - Users reported difficulty finding changelog and version history
  - Pricing documentation was comprehensive but hidden from navigation
  - Critical fields like `pricing_option_id` were not documented in API reference
  - Release announcements need better visibility on homepage

  These are documentation-only changes with no code or schema modifications.

## 2.1.0

### Minor Changes

- ae091dc: Simplify asset schema architecture by separating payload from requirements

  **Breaking Changes:**

  1. **Removed `asset_type` field from creative manifest wire format**

     - Asset payloads no longer include redundant type information
     - Asset types are determined by format specification, not declared in manifest
     - Validation is format-aware using `asset_id` lookup

  2. **Deleted `/creative/asset-types/*.json` individual schemas**

     - 11 duplicate schema files removed (image, video, audio, vast, daast, text, url, html, css, javascript, webhook)
     - Asset type registry now references `/core/assets/` schemas directly
     - Schema path changed: `/creative/asset-types/image.json` → `/core/assets/image-asset.json`

  3. **Removed constraint fields from core asset payloads**
     - `vast-asset.json`: Removed `max_wrapper_depth` (format constraint, not payload data)
     - `text-asset.json`: Removed `max_length` (format constraint, not payload data)
     - `webhook-asset.json`: Removed `fallback_required` (format requirement, not asset property)
     - Constraint fields belong in format specification `requirements`, not asset schemas

  **Why These Changes:**

  - **Format-aware validation**: Creative manifests are always validated in the context of their format specification. The format already defines what type each `asset_id` should be, making `asset_type` in the payload redundant.
  - **Single source of truth**: Each asset type now defined once in `/core/assets/`, eliminating 1,797 lines of duplicate code.
  - **Clear separation of concerns**: Payload schemas describe data structure; format specifications describe constraints and requirements.
  - **Reduced confusion**: No more wondering which schema to reference or where to put constraints.

  **Migration Guide:**

  ### Code Changes

  ```diff
  // Schema references
  - const schema = await fetch('/schemas/v1/creative/asset-types/image.json')
  + const schema = await fetch('/schemas/v1/core/assets/image-asset.json')

  // Creative manifest structure (removed asset_type)
  {
    "assets": {
      "banner_image": {
  -     "asset_type": "image",
        "url": "https://cdn.example.com/banner.jpg",
        "width": 300,
        "height": 250
      }
    }
  }

  // Validation changes - now format-aware
  - // Old: Standalone asset validation
  - validate(assetPayload, imageAssetSchema)

  + // New: Format-aware validation
  + const format = await fetchFormat(manifest.format_id)
  + const assetRequirement = format.assets_required.find(a => a.asset_id === assetId)
  + const assetSchema = await fetchAssetSchema(assetRequirement.asset_type)
  + validate(assetPayload, assetSchema)
  ```

  ### Validation Flow

  1. Read `format_id` from creative manifest
  2. Fetch format specification from format registry
  3. For each asset in manifest:
     - Look up `asset_id` in format's `assets_required`
     - If not found → error "unknown asset_id"
     - Get `asset_type` from format specification
     - Validate asset payload against that asset type's schema
  4. Check all required assets are present
  5. Validate type-specific constraints from format `requirements`

  ### Constraint Migration

  Constraints moved from asset schemas to format specification `requirements` field:

  ```diff
  // Format specification assets_required
  {
    "asset_id": "video_file",
    "asset_type": "video",
    "required": true,
    "requirements": {
      "width": 1920,
      "height": 1080,
      "duration_ms": 15000,
  +   "max_file_size_bytes": 10485760,
  +   "acceptable_codecs": ["h264", "h265"]
    }
  }
  ```

  These constraints are validated against asset payloads but are not part of the payload schema itself.

### Patch Changes

- 4be4140: Add Ebiquity as founding member
- f99a4a7: Clarify asset_id usage in creative manifests

  Previously ambiguous: The relationship between `asset_id` in format definitions and the keys used in creative manifest `assets` objects was unclear.

  Now explicit:

  - Creative manifest keys MUST exactly match `asset_id` values from the format's `assets_required` array
  - `asset_role` is optional/documentary—not used for manifest construction
  - Added validation guidance: what creative agents should do with mismatched keys

  Example: If a format defines `asset_id: "banner_image"`, your manifest must use:

  ```json
  {
    "assets": {
      "banner_image": { ... }  // ← Must match asset_id
    }
  }
  ```

  Changes: Updated creative-manifest.json, format.json schemas and creative-manifests.md documentation.

- 67d7994: Fix format_id documentation to match schema specification

All notable changes to the AdCP specification will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
