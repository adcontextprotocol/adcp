# AdCP SEO and LLM Discovery Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

The AdCP website (adcontextprotocol.org) has a strong foundation with clear messaging and good content structure, but faces significant SEO and discoverability challenges in a rapidly evolving advertising automation landscape. Key opportunities exist to improve technical SEO, keyword targeting, and positioning within the emerging MCP ecosystem.

## Current State Analysis

### Strengths
- **Clear Value Proposition**: "One protocol for every advertising platform" is compelling and well-communicated
- **Good Content Structure**: Hierarchical headings and logical content flow
- **Strong Developer Focus**: GitHub integration and open-source positioning appeal to technical audiences
- **Timely Market Position**: Built on Model Context Protocol (MCP), aligning with 2024-2025 AI automation trends

### Critical SEO Gaps

#### Technical SEO Issues
- **Missing Meta Tags**: No meta description, OpenGraph tags, or Twitter Cards
- **No Schema Markup**: Missing structured data for Organization, Product, or WebSite schemas
- **Mobile Optimization Unclear**: No visible viewport meta tag
- **Performance Optimization**: Docusaurus site could be optimized further

#### Content Discoverability Challenges
- **Limited Search Presence**: Only 1 result when searching for AdCP-related terms
- **Weak Keyword Coverage**: Not ranking for relevant programmatic advertising terms
- **Low Brand Recognition**: "AdCP" and "Ad Context Protocol" have minimal search volume

## Market Context & Competition

### Industry Landscape (2024-2025)
- **API-First Development**: 74% of developers now fully API-first (up 11% from 2023)

- **Programmatic Growth**: $65.21B projected non-video programmatic ad spending in 2025

### Competitive Positioning Gaps
