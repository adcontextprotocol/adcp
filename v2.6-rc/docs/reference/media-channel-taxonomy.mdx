# Media Channel Taxonomy

<Info>
**Status**: Draft Specification
**Version**: 1.0.0-draft
**Last Updated**: 2026-01-19
</Info>

This specification defines a standardized taxonomy for advertising media channels. It is designed for interoperability across media planning tools, ad tech platforms, and AI-powered advertising agents.

## Motivation

The advertising industry lacks a standardized channel taxonomy. While IAB Tech Lab provides taxonomies for content, audience, and ad products, no equivalent exists for media channels. This leads to:

- Inconsistent channel naming across platforms
- Difficulty aggregating cross-channel campaign data
- Confusion between channels, formats, and buying models
- Friction in automated media planning workflows

This specification addresses these gaps by defining:

1. **Media Channels** - Where advertising reaches audiences
2. **Property Types** - Addressable inventory surfaces with verifiable ownership
3. **Clear distinction** between channels, formats, and buying models

## Terminology

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119).

## Definitions

### Media Channel

A **media channel** describes WHERE advertising reaches people. It represents the distribution environment or medium through which ads are delivered to audiences.

Channels are defined by the **audience experience context**, not by:
- How the ad looks (that's a **format**)
- How inventory is purchased (that's a **buying model**)
- What technology serves the ad (that's **infrastructure**)

### Property Type

A **property type** describes a specific addressable inventory surface where:
- Ownership can be verified (e.g., via `adagents.json`)
- Ads can be programmatically served
- Identifiers exist for the property (domains, app IDs, device IDs)

Property types are a SUBSET of channels. Some channels (like `linear_tv` or `print`) may not have addressable property types in the digital sense.

### Format Category

A **format category** describes HOW an ad renders - its creative unit type. Examples: `video`, `audio`, `display`, `native`. Formats are orthogonal to channels; a video ad can appear across web, CTV, social, and mobile app channels.

### Buying Model

A **buying model** describes HOW inventory is purchased. Examples: programmatic auction, direct/guaranteed, influencer partnership, sponsorship. Buying models are orthogonal to channels.

## Understanding Channels vs Property Types

A common source of confusion is the relationship between channels and property types. This section clarifies when to use each concept.

### The Key Distinction

| Concept | Question It Answers | Determined By | Example |
|---------|---------------------|---------------|---------|
| **Channel** | How do agencies allocate budget? | Buying context / offering type | `commerce_media` |
| **Property Type** | Where does the ad technically render? | Addressable inventory surface | `website` |

**Channels reflect how the industry buys media**, not necessarily where ads technically appear. A single ad placement might involve:
- **Channel**: `commerce_media` (bought through Target Roundel)
- **Property Type**: `website` (renders on target.com)
- **Format**: `display` (300x250 banner)

### Why This Matters

Consider retail media: when an agency allocates budget to "retail media," they're buying:
1. Ads that appear on retailer websites and apps
2. Ads on other publishers using retailer first-party data
3. In-store digital screens

All of these are `commerce_media` channel, but the property types vary (`website`, `mobile_app`, `dooh`).

### Channels That Describe Buying Context

Some channels primarily describe **how inventory is purchased** rather than a distinct technical surface:

| Channel | Buying Context | May Appear On |
|---------|----------------|---------------|
| `social` | Social platform ad tools | `website`, `mobile_app` property types |
| `influencer` | Creator partnerships | `social`, `web`, `podcast` channels |
| `sponsorship` | Sponsorship deals | Various channels and properties |
| `commerce_media` | Retail media networks | `website`, `mobile_app`, `dooh` |
| `ai_agents` | AI platform integrations | `website`, `mobile_app`, `desktop_app` |

### When to Use Each

**Use channel when:**
- Filtering products by media type
- Reporting on budget allocation
- Describing where audiences are reached
- Planning cross-channel campaigns

**Use property_type when:**
- Validating inventory ownership via `adagents.json`
- Technical ad serving decisions
- Verifying authorized properties
- Platform-specific integrations

**Note**: Commerce media is distinguished by its transactional context and closed-loop attribution capabilities. Ads appear within purchase-intent environments where conversion can be directly measured.

## Property Types

Property types describe addressable inventory surfaces with verifiable ownership. They are used in `adagents.json` for authorization validation.

### Property Type Enum

| Property Type | Description | Typical Channel(s) |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| `website` | Web properties accessible via browser | `web` |
| `mobile_app` | Native mobile applications | `mobile_app`, `social`, `gaming` |
| `ctv_app` | Connected TV applications | `ctv` |
| `desktop_app` | Desktop applications (Electron, native, Chromium wrappers) | `streaming_audio`, `ai_agents`, `gaming` |
| `dooh` | Digital out-of-home screen networks | `dooh` |
| `podcast` | Podcast feeds and episodes | `podcast` |
| `radio` | Radio station properties | `radio` |
| `streaming_audio` | Digital audio streaming properties | `streaming_audio` |

### Channels Without Property Types

The following channels do not have corresponding property types because they lack addressable, verifiable inventory surfaces in the traditional sense:

- `linear_tv` - Broadcast/cable inventory is managed through different authorization mechanisms
- `ooh` - Physical inventory lacks digital identifiers
- `print` - Physical publication inventory
- `cinema` - Theater inventory management systems
- `email` - Email list ownership differs from property authorization
- `influencer` - Creator relationships rather than property ownership
- `ai_agents` - Emerging channel, property model TBD
- `sponsorship` - Event/content relationships rather than properties
- `commerce_media` - Platform-managed inventory within retail/marketplace ecosystems
- `search` - Platform-managed inventory

## Implementation

### JSON Schema

Channels are defined in the AdCP schema at:

```
/schemas/v1/enums/channels.json
```

```json
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "$id": "/schemas/enums/channels.json",
  "title": "Media Channel",
  "description": "Standardized advertising media channels describing where ads reach audiences",
  "type": "string",
  "enum": [
    "web",
    "ctv",
    "mobile_app",
    "social",
    "search",
    "linear_tv",
    "radio",
    "streaming_audio",
    "podcast",
    "dooh",
    "ooh",
    "print",
    "cinema",
    "email",
    "gaming",
    "influencer",
    "ai_agents",
    "sponsorship",
    "commerce_media"
  ]
}
```

### Usage in Product Discovery

When filtering products by channel:

```json
{
  "filters": {
    "channels": ["ctv", "streaming_audio", "podcast"]
  }
}
```

### Usage in Property Definitions

Properties in `adagents.json` use `property_type`, not `channel`:

```json
{
  "properties": [
    {
      "property_id": "example_ctv",
      "property_type": "ctv_app",
      "name": "Example Streaming App",
      "identifiers": [
        {"type": "roku_store_id", "value": "12345"}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Extensibility

Implementations MAY support additional channels beyond this specification using the `ext` field pattern:

```json
{
  "channel": "web",
  "ext": {
    "sub_channel": "programmatic_guaranteed"
  }
}
```

## Versioning

This taxonomy follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):

- **MAJOR**: Removing channels, changing channel semantics
- **MINOR**: Adding new channels (append-only)
- **PATCH**: Clarifying descriptions, fixing typos

Adding new channels is a MINOR version change and MUST NOT break existing implementations.

## Migration from Legacy Channel Values

Prior to this taxonomy, AdCP used a different set of channel values that conflated channels with formats. The following table maps legacy values to the new taxonomy:

| Legacy Value | New Channel(s) | Notes |
|--------------|----------------|-------|
| `display` | `web`, `mobile_app`, `dooh` | Display is a **format**, not a channel. Map to the appropriate channel based on where the ad appears. |
| `video` | `web`, `ctv`, `mobile_app`, `social` | Video is a **format**. Map to the channel where video ads are delivered. |
| `audio` | `streaming_audio`, `podcast`, `radio` | Audio is a **format**. Map to the specific audio channel. |
| `native` | `web`, `mobile_app`, `social`, `commerce_media` | Native is a **format**. Map to the channel where native ads appear. |
| `dooh` | `dooh` | No change. |
| `ctv` | `ctv` | No change. |
| `podcast` | `podcast` | No change. |
| `retail` | `commerce_media` | Renamed to encompass retail media networks, marketplaces, and transactional platforms. |
| `social` | `social` | No change. |

### Migration Guidance

1. **Identify the delivery context**: Determine WHERE the ad reaches the audience, not what format it uses.

2. **Separate channel from format**: If your system stored `video` as a channel, you likely need to track both the channel (`web`, `ctv`, etc.) AND the format (`video`) separately.

3. **Update filters**: When filtering products, use the new channel values. For format filtering, use the `format_types` field instead.

4. **Review integrations**: Any systems passing channel values to AdCP APIs will need to be updated to use the new taxonomy.

## Edge Cases and Ambiguities

Real-world ad placements often don't fit neatly into a single category. This section provides guidance for common edge cases.

### In-App Browsers (WebViews)

When a user clicks a link in a social app (Facebook, Twitter/X) and views content in the app's embedded browser:

| Scenario | Channel | Property Type | Reasoning |
|----------|---------|---------------|-----------|
| Ads on cnn.com viewed in Facebook's WebView | `web` | `website` | Ads are bought through standard web programmatic targeting cnn.com |
| Facebook's own sponsored content in the feed | `social` | `mobile_app` | Bought through Facebook Ads Manager |

The WebView is just a technical container. Ads on the destination site (cnn.com) are still `web` channel because they're bought through standard web programmatic, not through the social platform's ad tools.

### Desktop Apps as Chromium Wrappers

Applications like Spotify Desktop, Discord, or Slack that are built on Electron/Chromium:

| Attribute | Value | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| **Channel** | Varies (`streaming_audio`, `social`, etc.) | Based on buying context |
| **Property Type** | `desktop_app` | Native desktop application |
| **Format** | Varies | Audio, display, video |

For Spotify Desktop: channel = `streaming_audio`, property_type = `desktop_app`.

### AI Widgets on Publisher Websites

When an AI chatbot widget appears on a traditional publisher's website, the channel depends on user intent and buying context—similar to outstream video (OLV):

| Scenario | Channel | Reasoning |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| User's primary focus is the AI assistant (dedicated interaction) | `ai_agents` | User intent is conversational AI |
| AI widget is peripheral to page content (like OLV autoplay) | `web` | User focus is the publisher content |
| Ads bought through AI platform's ad tools | `ai_agents` | Buying context is AI platform |
| Ads bought through standard web programmatic | `web` | Buying context is standard web |

This mirrors how OLV is treated: an autoplay video unit in an article is `web` (user is reading), but a dedicated video player experience shifts the context.

### Commerce vs Web Display

Display banners appearing on retail websites (e.g., kohls.com):

| Scenario | Channel | Reasoning |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| Bought through Kohl's retail media network | `commerce_media` | Buying context is retail media |
| Bought through programmatic DSP targeting the domain | `web` | Buying context is standard web programmatic |

The same ad placement can be different channels depending on how it was purchased.

### Search vs AI Agents

As search engines incorporate conversational AI:

| Scenario | Channel | Reasoning |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| Traditional search ads on Google/Bing | `search` | Standard search ad buying |
| Sponsored results in Perplexity | `ai_agents` | Bought through AI platform |
| AI-generated answers with ads on Google SGE | `search` | Bought through Google Ads |

The distinction is buying context, not whether AI is involved in generating results.

### Gaming vs Mobile App

| Scenario | Channel | Reasoning |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| Rewarded video in Candy Crush via Unity Ads | `gaming` | Gaming-specific ad network |
| Banner in Candy Crush via AdMob general inventory | `mobile_app` | Standard mobile programmatic |
| Esports tournament sponsorship | `gaming` | Gaming audience context |

### Influencer vs Social

| Scenario | Channel | Reasoning |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| Buying promoted posts through Instagram Ads Manager | `social` | Platform ad tools |
| Contracting an influencer to create sponsored content | `influencer` | Creator partnership |
| Platform-inserted ads around creator content | `social` | Platform ad tools |
