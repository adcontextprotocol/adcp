Top-level values (si_agent_url, offerings) are checked directly on the PromotedOfferings object. For brand.* paths, the brand reference must be resolved (looked up from brand.json or registry) before checking the nested field. If the reference cannot be resolved, all brand.* requirements are considered unmet. Paths are limited to two segments.",
