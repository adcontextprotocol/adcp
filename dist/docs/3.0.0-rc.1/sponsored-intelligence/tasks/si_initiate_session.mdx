title: si_initiate_session
---

Start a conversational session with a brand agent. The host platform invokes this task when a user expresses interest in engaging with a brand.

## Request

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `context` | string | Yes | Natural language description of user intent |
| `identity` | object | Yes | User identity with consent status |
| `media_buy_id` | string | No | AdCP media buy ID if triggered by advertising |
| `placement` | string | No | Where the session was triggered (e.g., "chatgpt_search") |
| `offering_id` | string | No | Brand-specific offering reference to apply |
| `supported_capabilities` | object | No | What the host platform supports |
| `offering_token` | string | No | Token from `si_get_offering` for correlation |

### Offering Token

If a host performed a [`si_get_offering`](./si_get_offering) lookup before initiating, include the token for **session continuity**:

```json
{
  "offering_token": "offering_abc123xyz"
}
```

The token lets the brand agent know exactly what products were shown to the user (and in what order). This enables natural conversation flow:

- User sees: "Nike Pegasus ($89), Air Max ($129), Vomero ($139)"
- User says: "Tell me more about the middle one"
- Brand agent resolves "middle one" → Air Max via the token's stored context

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `consent_granted` | boolean | Yes | Must be `true` |

| `consent_scope` | array | Yes | Fields the user agreed to share |

| Field | Type | Required | Description |

## Key Points

1. **Context is a conversation handoff** - The host tells the brand agent what the user needs. The brand agent responds naturally, continuing the conversation.

2. **Brand looks up loyalty data** - If Jane's email is recognized, Delta retrieves her SkyMiles status automatically. Hosts don't store loyalty numbers.

3. **offering_id is brand-specific** - The brand interprets this reference to apply promotions, discounts, or loyalty rewards. Hosts pass it through without needing to understand offering semantics.

4. **Capability negotiation** - The response includes `negotiated_capabilities` showing what features this session can use (intersection of brand and host capabilities).

5. **Clear PII with explicit consent** - When `consent_granted` is true, actual email/name are passed (not hashed). This is a direct, consented handoff.
