## Allocation, Not Day Trading

RTB treats advertising like day trading: *"What is this impression worth?"* It works for fungible inventory but commoditizes everything.

AdCP enables portfolio-level allocation: *"How should I invest my ad budget?"* This mirrors how advertisers actually think—they buy outcomes, not impressions.

  Why the RTB mental model doesn't fit how advertisers actually make decisions.

## The Fragmentation Problem

Today, advertisers face three completely different buying systems:

| Paradigm | Era | How It Works |
|----------|-----|--------------|
| **RTB/Biddable** | Legacy web | Real-time bidding via OpenRTB |
| **API-based** | Modern social, AI | Platform-specific APIs (Meta, TikTok) |
| **Direct IO** | Legacy | Insertion orders, manual deals |

Each requires different integrations, tools, workflows, and expertise. 90% of ad spend never touches RTB—it lives in walled gardens, direct deals, and premium inventory.

AdCP creates a **universal API standard** that unifies all three under one umbrella.

## Omnichannel By Design

Buying billboards is fundamentally different from buying social links:

- **Different pricing**: Flat rate vs CPM vs engagement-based
- **Different creatives**: Static images vs dynamic video vs conversational AI
- **Different measurement**: Impressions vs engagement vs footfall

AdCP creates a conceptual layer that abstracts these differences while preserving what makes each channel unique. One protocol, any channel.

## Why Agents?

Intelligent agents reduce the cost of managing complex, negotiated deals:

- **Adapt to nuances** without over-specifying everything in code
- **Handle variability** across platforms and channels
- **Natural language** lets buyers describe intent, not configure parameters
- **Scale relationships** from 3-5 platforms to 20+ without scaling teams

## The Protocol Layer for AI

AdCP isn't just unifying legacy systems—it's the protocol layer for emerging AI surfaces.

### Sponsored Intelligence

Like VAST defined video ad serving, SI defines conversational brand experiences in AI assistants. When an AI says *"Delta has flights to Boston—want me to connect you with their assistant?"*—SI defines what happens next.

### Brand identity

Standardized brand identity for AI-powered creative generation. Brands express who they are—colors, tone, assets—in formats AI systems can consume.

### Promoted Offerings

The unified schema connecting brand identity, products, creative assets, and conversational AI. This bridges traditional advertising and conversational commerce.

Together, these support fully AI-powered systems like Performance Max that need structured brand inputs, not manual campaign configuration.

## Design Implications

These goals drive AdCP's technical design:

- **Asynchronous**: Deals take time. This is not a real-time protocol—operations may take minutes to days.
- **Human-in-the-loop**: Some decisions need human approval. Publishers can require manual sign-off.
- **Multiple transports**: MCP and A2A provide the same tasks through different protocols.

## The Protocol Family

| Protocol | Purpose | Key Tasks |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| **Media Buy** | Campaign execution | `get_products`, `create_media_buy` |
| **Signals** | Audience targeting | `get_signals`, `activate_signal` |
| **Creative** | Ad creative management | `build_creative`, `sync_creatives` |
| **Governance** | Brand suitability, quality, compliance | Property lists, content standards |
| **Sponsored Intelligence** | Conversational brand experiences | `si_initiate_session` |
| **Curation** | Inventory packaging | Coming soon |
