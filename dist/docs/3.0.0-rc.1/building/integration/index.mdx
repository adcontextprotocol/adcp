This section covers the foundational technical concepts for building any AdCP implementation - whether you're building a client, a server, or an orchestrator.

## Getting Started

### 1. Choose a Protocol
- **MCP** for tool-based integrations (Claude, MCP-compatible systems)
- **A2A** for task-based integrations (Google AI, agent-to-agent workflows)

### 2. Understand Authentication
- How agents and accounts are identified
- Bearer token patterns
- See [Authentication](/dist/docs/3.0.0-rc.1/building/integration/authentication)

### 3. Handle Context
- `context_id` for conversation continuity
- `task_id` for tracking async operations
- See [Context & Sessions](/dist/docs/3.0.0-rc.1/building/integration/context-sessions)

## What Both Protocols Provide

Regardless of protocol choice, you get:

| Feature | Support |
|---------|---------|
| All AdCP tasks | Same tasks, same capabilities |
| Unified status system | `completed`, `working`, `input-required`, `failed`, etc. |
| Context management | Session continuity across requests |
| Async operations | Long-running tasks with webhooks or polling |
| Human-in-the-loop | Approval workflows for sensitive operations |
| Error handling | Consistent error codes and recovery patterns |
