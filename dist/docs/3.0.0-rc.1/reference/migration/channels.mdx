# Migrating channels

AdCP v3 replaces v2's 9 channels with 19 planning-oriented channels that reflect how buyers allocate budgets. Five channels carry over unchanged, while the rest are split, removed, or renamed.

## Why the channel model changed

v2 mixed format-oriented channels (`video`, `audio`, `native`) with planning-oriented ones (`social`, `ctv`, `dooh`). Buyers don't plan budgets around rendering technology — they plan around media types. A video budget gets split between OLV, CTV, and cinema. An audio budget spans radio, streaming, and podcasts.

v3 channels consistently match how agencies structure media plans.

## Channel mapping

| v2 channel | v3 channel(s) | Notes |
|------------|---------------|-------|
| `display` | `display` | Unchanged |
| `video` | `olv`, `linear_tv`, `cinema` | Split by distribution (`ctv` was already separate in v2) |
| `audio` | `radio`, `streaming_audio` | Split by distribution (`podcast` was already separate in v2) |
| `native` | Removed | Use format-level properties instead |
| `social` | `social` | Unchanged |
| `ctv` | `ctv` | Unchanged |
| `podcast` | `podcast` | Unchanged |
| `dooh` | `dooh` | Unchanged |
| `retail` | `retail_media` | Renamed for clarity |

## Complete v3 channel enum

All 19 values from the `channels.json` schema:

```
display, olv, social, search, ctv, linear_tv,
radio, streaming_audio, podcast, dooh, ooh,
print, cinema, email, gaming, retail_media,
influencer, affiliate, product_placement
```

| Channel | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `display` | Digital display advertising (banners, native, rich media) across web and app |
| `olv` | Online video advertising outside CTV (pre-roll, outstream, in-app video) |
| `social` | Social media platforms |
| `search` | Search engine advertising and search networks |
| `ctv` | Connected TV and streaming on television screens |
| `linear_tv` | Traditional broadcast and cable television |
| `radio` | Traditional AM/FM radio broadcast |
| `streaming_audio` | Digital audio streaming services |
| `podcast` | Podcast advertising (host-read or dynamically inserted) |
| `dooh` | Digital out-of-home screens in public spaces |
| `ooh` | Classic out-of-home (physical billboards, transit, etc.) |
| `print` | Newspapers, magazines, and other print publications |
| `cinema` | Movie theater advertising |
| `email` | Email advertising and sponsored newsletter content |
| `gaming` | In-game advertising across platforms (intrinsic in-game, rewarded video, playable ads) |
| `retail_media` | Retail media networks and commerce marketplaces |
| `influencer` | Creator and influencer marketing partnerships |
| `affiliate` | Affiliate networks, comparison sites, and performance-based partnerships |
| `product_placement` | Product placement, branded content, and sponsorship integrations |

<Note>
The `gaming` channel covers all in-game advertising. Rewarded video in gaming apps could also be classified as `olv` — use `gaming` when the inventory comes from a gaming budget, `olv` when it comes from a video budget.
</Note>

## Migrating `video` products

The v2 `video` channel must be split across 3 v3 channels based on distribution (`ctv` was already a separate v2 channel):

- **`olv`** — Online video (web, mobile app, social): pre-roll, outstream, in-app video
- **`linear_tv`** — Traditional broadcast and cable television
- **`cinema`** — Movie theater pre-show advertising

A single publisher may support multiple channels. A streaming service might declare both `olv` and `ctv` if their inventory serves both mobile and TV.

## Migrating `audio` products

The v2 `audio` channel splits into 2 v3 channels (`podcast` was already a separate v2 channel):

- **`radio`** — Traditional AM/FM radio broadcast
- **`streaming_audio`** — Digital audio streaming services (music platforms)

## Migrating `native` products

v3 removes `native` as a channel. Native is a rendering style, not a budget category.

If you have products tagged `native` in v2, assign the appropriate v3 channel based on how the budget is planned:
- Native display ads -> `display`
- Native social ads -> `social`
- Native content recommendations -> `display` or `affiliate` depending on model

## Migrating `retail` products

Simple rename from `retail` to `retail_media`.

## Multi-channel products

v3 products declare an array of channels, so a single product can span multiple channels. Here's a capabilities response showing a seller that supports multiple channels:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://adcontextprotocol.org/schemas/v3/protocol/get-adcp-capabilities-response.json",
  "adcp": {
    "major_versions": [3]
  },
  "supported_protocols": ["media_buy"],
  "media_buy": {
    "portfolio": {
      "primary_channels": ["display", "olv", "ctv"],
      "publisher_domains": ["pinnaclemedia.example.com"],
      "primary_countries": ["US"]
    }
  }
}
```

When products are returned from `get_products`, each product's `channels` array declares which channels that product is sold as:

```json
{
  "channels": ["olv", "ctv"]
}
```

## Declaring channel support in capabilities

Buyers should call `get_adcp_capabilities` to discover which channels a seller supports before filtering `get_products` requests. The `portfolio.primary_channels` field lists the seller's main channels.

## Migration steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Audit channel usage">
    Find all places your code reads or writes channel values.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Map old to new">
    Use the mapping table above to convert each value. Note that `display`, `social`, `ctv`, `podcast`, and `dooh` are unchanged.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Handle multi-mapping">
    Where v2 `video` or `audio` maps to multiple v3 channels, classify each product by its distribution context.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Update filters">
    If your buyer agent filters by channel, update to the new values.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Update capabilities">
    Implement `get_adcp_capabilities` with correct channel declarations.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test validation">
    v3 schema validation will reject old channel values like `video`, `audio`, `native`, and `retail`.
  </Step>
</Steps>
