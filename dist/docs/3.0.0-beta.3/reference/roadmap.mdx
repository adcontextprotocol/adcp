## Release Principles

AdCP follows these principles for releases:

### Version Planning
- **Major versions** (3.0, 4.0) - Breaking changes, major new capabilities
- **Minor versions** (3.1, 3.2) - New features, backward-compatible additions
- **Patch versions** (3.0.1, 3.0.2) - Bug fixes, documentation updates

### Community Input
- Working group proposals drive feature development
- Public comment periods before major changes
- Reference implementations validate design decisions
- Beta releases for testing before final release

### Backward Compatibility
- Breaking changes only in major versions
- 6-month deprecation period for removed features
- Migration guides for all breaking changes
- Support for previous major version during transition
