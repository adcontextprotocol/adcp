# validate_property_delivery

<Info>
**AdCP 3.0 Proposal** - This task is under development for AdCP 3.0.
</Info>

Validates delivery records against a property list to determine compliance. Answers two questions:
1. **Property compliance**: Did my impressions land on properties in my list?
2. **Supply path authorization**: Was the sales agent authorized to sell that inventory?

## Use Cases

- **Post-campaign validation**: Verify that impressions were delivered to compliant properties
- **Supply path verification**: Confirm sales agents were authorized by publishers
- **Real-time monitoring**: Check compliance rate during campaign execution
- **Audit trails**: Generate compliance reports for regulatory or brand safety reviews

```

### Response Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `list_id` | string | ID of the property list validated against |
| `summary` | object | Raw counts for property compliance validation |
| `aggregate` | object | Optional computed metrics from the governance agent |
| `results` | array | Per-record validation results |
| `validated_at` | datetime | When validation was performed |
| `list_resolved_at` | datetime | Resolution timestamp of the property list used |

### Summary Fields

The summary provides raw counts - consumers calculate rates as needed:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `total_records` | Total records validated |
| `total_impressions` | Total impressions across all records |
| `compliant_records` / `compliant_impressions` | Records/impressions in the property list |
| `non_compliant_records` / `non_compliant_impressions` | Records/impressions NOT in the property list |
| `not_covered_records` / `not_covered_impressions` | Identifier recognized but no data available |
| `unidentified_records` / `unidentified_impressions` | Identifier type not resolvable |

### Validation Statuses

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `compliant` | Identifier is in the resolved property list |
| `non_compliant` | Identifier is NOT in the resolved property list |
| `not_covered` | Identifier recognized but governance agent has no data for it |
| `unidentified` | Identifier type not resolvable by this agent |

## Understanding not_covered vs unidentified

These two statuses distinguish different types of "unknown" scenarios:

**`not_covered`** - The governance agent recognized the identifier (e.g., it's a valid domain) but doesn't have data for that specific property. This happens when:
- A property is too new to be in the agent's database
- The property exists but hasn't been evaluated yet
- The agent's coverage doesn't include that property category

**`unidentified`** - The governance agent couldn't recognize the identifier at all. This happens when:
- Client-side detection failed to capture the property
- The identifier type isn't supported (e.g., agent handles domains but received an app ID)
- The identifier value is malformed or invalid

Both statuses should be excluded from compliance rate calculations - you cannot penalize for detection or coverage gaps.

## Optional Aggregate Metrics

Governance agents can optionally return computed metrics in the `aggregate` field:

```json
"aggregate": {
  "score": 68.7,
  "grade": "C+",
  "label": "68.7% compliant",
  "methodology_url": "https://governance.example.com/methodology"
}
```

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `score` | Numeric score (scale is agent-defined, typically 0-100) |
| `grade` | Letter grade or category (e.g., "A+", "B-", "Gold") |
| `label` | Human-readable summary (e.g., "85% compliant") |
| `methodology_url` | URL explaining how the aggregate was calculated |

The `aggregate` field is optional and agent-specific. Consumers should not assume a particular format - always check `methodology_url` for interpretation.

## Calculating Your Own Rates

The response always includes raw counts. Calculate rates as needed:

```python
# Compliance rate (exclude unverifiable from denominator)
unverifiable = summary.not_covered_impressions + summary.unidentified_impressions
verifiable = summary.total_impressions - unverifiable
compliance_rate = summary.compliant_impressions / verifiable if verifiable > 0 else None
```

In the example above:
- Compliant impressions: 103
- Non-compliant impressions: 47
- not_covered + unidentified impressions: 50 (excluded)
- Compliance rate: 103 / (200 - 50) = 103 / 150 = 68.7%

## Violation Codes

| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `not_in_list` | Identifier not found in the resolved property list |
| `excluded` | Identifier explicitly excluded via `exclude_identifiers` filter |
| `country_mismatch` | Property lacks feature data for required countries |
| `channel_mismatch` | Property doesn't support required channels |
| `feature_failed` | Property failed a `feature_requirements` filter |

### Feature Violation Details

When a property fails a feature requirement, the violation includes the feature details:

```json
{
  "identifier": { "type": "domain", "value": "low-quality-site.example" },
  "status": "non_compliant",
  "impressions": 150,
  "violations": [
    {
      "code": "feature_failed",
      "message": "Property failed mfa_score requirement (min: 85)",
      "feature_id": "mfa_score",
      "requirement": {
        "min_value": 85
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

The `feature_id` and `requirement` fields are optional - they're included when the violation is due to a feature requirement filter.

## Supply Path Authorization

When `sales_agent_url` is provided in delivery records, the governance agent validates that the sales agent is authorized to sell the property by checking the publisher's `adagents.json`.

### Request with Authorization

```json
{
  "list_id": "pl_abc123",
  "records": [
    {
      "identifier": { "type": "domain", "value": "www.nytimes.com" },
      "impressions": 103,
      "sales_agent_url": "https://legitimate-ssp.example.com"
    },
    {
      "identifier": { "type": "domain", "value": "www.nytimes.com" },
      "impressions": 50,
      "sales_agent_url": "https://unauthorized-reseller.example.com"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Response with Authorization

When authorization is validated, each result includes an `authorization` field:

```json
{
  "list_id": "pl_abc123",
  "summary": {
    "total_records": 2,
    "total_impressions": 153,
    "compliant_records": 2,
    "compliant_impressions": 153,
    "non_compliant_records": 0,
    "non_compliant_impressions": 0,
    "unknown_records": 0,
    "unknown_impressions": 0
  },
  "authorization_summary": {
    "records_checked": 2,
    "impressions_checked": 153,
    "authorized_records": 1,
    "authorized_impressions": 103,
    "unauthorized_records": 1,
    "unauthorized_impressions": 50,
    "unknown_records": 0,
    "unknown_impressions": 0
  },
  "results": [
    {
      "identifier": { "type": "domain", "value": "www.nytimes.com" },
      "status": "compliant",
      "impressions": 50,
      "authorization": {
        "status": "unauthorized",
        "publisher_domain": "nytimes.com",
        "sales_agent_url": "https://unauthorized-reseller.example.com",
        "violation": {
          "code": "agent_not_authorized",
          "message": "Sales agent not listed in nytimes.com/.well-known/adagents.json"
        }
      }
    }
  ],
  "validated_at": "2026-01-04T19:00:00Z"
}
```

### Authorization Statuses

| Status | Meaning | Included in authorization_rate? |
|--------|---------|--------------------------------|
| `authorized` | Sales agent is listed in publisher's adagents.json | Yes (numerator) |
| `unauthorized` | Sales agent is NOT listed in publisher's adagents.json | Yes (denominator only) |
| `unknown` | Could not fetch or parse adagents.json | No (excluded) |

### Authorization Violation Codes

| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `agent_not_authorized` | Sales agent URL not found in publisher's authorized_agents list |
| `adagents_not_found` | Publisher's adagents.json could not be fetched (404, timeout, etc.) |
| `adagents_invalid` | Publisher's adagents.json exists but is malformed |
| `property_not_declared` | Property identifier not declared in publisher's adagents.json |

### Two Independent Checks

Property compliance and authorization are **independent checks**. A record can be:

| Property Status | Authorization Status | Meaning |
|-----------------|---------------------|---------|
| compliant | authorized | Fully valid - property in list, sold by authorized agent |
| compliant | unauthorized | Property is approved but sold by unauthorized reseller |
| non_compliant | authorized | Authorized agent sold property outside your list |
| non_compliant | unauthorized | Neither property nor agent validated |

Both checks use the same "unknown excludes from rate" pattern - you cannot penalize for detection gaps.

## Best Practices

### Batch Validation

For large-scale validation, batch records up to the 10,000 limit:

```python
def validate_delivery_batch(records, list_id, governance_agent):
    """Validate delivery records in batches."""
    batch_size = 10000
    all_results = []

    for i in range(0, len(records), batch_size):
        batch = records[i:i + batch_size]
        response = governance_agent.validate_property_delivery(
            list_id=list_id,
            records=batch
        )
        all_results.extend(response.results)

    return all_results
```

### Sampling Strategy

For real-time monitoring during campaign execution, validate a statistical sample rather than all records:

```python
import random

def sample_and_validate(records, sample_size=1000):
    """Validate a random sample for real-time monitoring."""
    sample = random.sample(records, min(sample_size, len(records)))
    return governance_agent.validate_property_delivery(
        list_id=list_id,
        records=sample
    )
```

### Handling Unknown Records

Track unknown rates separately to identify detection gaps:

```python
def analyze_validation(response):
    """Analyze validation results with unknown handling."""
    summary = response.summary

    # Core compliance metric
    compliance_rate = summary.compliance_rate

    # Detection quality metric
    unknown_rate = summary.unknown_impressions / summary.total_impressions

    if unknown_rate > 0.1:
        print(f"Warning: {unknown_rate:.1%} of impressions unresolvable")

    return {
        "compliance_rate": compliance_rate,
        "unknown_rate": unknown_rate,
        "non_compliant_impressions": summary.non_compliant_impressions
    }
```
