The Brand Protocol enables brands to claim their identity and establish a verifiable source of truth through a standardized discovery mechanism. By hosting a `brand.json` file at a well-known location, brands can declare their identity, brand hierarchy, and optionally designate official brand agents.

## Purpose

The Brand Protocol addresses buy-side identity in advertising, providing the same clarity that the Property Protocol provides for the sell-side:

| Sell Side | Buy Side | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| Publisher | **House** | Corporate entity (Nike, Inc., P&G) |
| Property | **Brand** | Advertising identity (Nike, Air Jordan) |
| Inventory | **Destination** | Landing pages, apps |

This parallel structure makes brands first-class citizens in AdCP.

## How It Works

Brands host a `brand.json` file at `/.well-known/brand.json` on their domain. The file can take one of four forms:

1. **Brand Agent**: Points to an MCP agent that provides brand information
2. **House Portfolio**: Contains full brand hierarchy with all brands and properties
3. **House Redirect**: Points to a house domain that contains the portfolio
4. **Authoritative Location**: Points to a hosted brand.json URL

    Agent->>Domain: GET /.well-known/brand.json
    alt House Redirect
        Domain-->>Agent: { "house": "nikeinc.com" }
        Agent->>House: GET /.well-known/brand.json
        House-->>Agent: Full portfolio (house + brands)
    else Brand Agent
        Domain-->>Agent: { "brand_agent": { "url": "..." } }
        Agent->>BrandAgent: MCP: get_brand_manifest
        BrandAgent-->>Agent: Brand manifest
    else House Portfolio
        Domain-->>Agent: Full portfolio (house + brands)
    end
```

## Brand Architecture

The protocol supports Keller's brand architecture models:

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `master` | Primary brand of house | Nike for Nike, Inc. |
| `sub_brand` | Carries parent name | Nike SB |
| `endorsed` | Independent identity, backed by parent | Air Jordan "by Nike" |
| `independent` | Operates separately | Converse under Nike, Inc. |

## Example: House Portfolio

A house domain with multiple brands:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://adcontextprotocol.org/schemas/v1/brand.json",
  "version": "1.0",
  "house": {
    "domain": "nikeinc.com",
    "name": "Nike, Inc.",
    "architecture": "hybrid"
  },
  "brands": [
    {
      "id": "nike",
      "names": [{"en": "Nike"}, {"zh": "耐克"}],
      "keller_type": "master",
      "properties": [
        {"type": "website", "identifier": "nike.com", "primary": true},
        {"type": "mobile_app", "store": "apple", "identifier": "com.nike.omega"}
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "air_jordan",
      "names": [{"en": "Air Jordan"}, {"en": "Jordan"}],
      "keller_type": "endorsed",
      "parent_brand": "nike",
      "properties": [
        {"type": "website", "identifier": "jordan.com"},
        {"type": "website", "identifier": "jumpman23.com"}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Example: Brand Agent

A brand with an MCP agent that provides brand information:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://adcontextprotocol.org/schemas/v1/brand.json",
  "version": "1.0",
  "brand_agent": {
    "url": "https://agent.acme.com/mcp",
    "id": "acme_brand_agent"
  }
}
```

The agent implements `get_brand_manifest({ house, brand_id })` to return brand manifest data.

## Example: House Redirect

A brand domain pointing to its house:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://adcontextprotocol.org/schemas/v1/brand.json",
  "house": "nikeinc.com"
}
```

## Resolution Flow

Given any domain, the protocol resolves to a canonical brand:

```
jumpman23.com
  -> fetch /.well-known/brand.json
  -> { "house": "nikeinc.com" }
  -> fetch nikeinc.com/.well-known/brand.json
  -> search brands[] for property matching "jumpman23.com"
  -> found in Air Jordan brand's properties
  -> Result: { house: "nikeinc.com", brand_id: "air_jordan" }
```

## Use Cases

### Creative Generation

When a creative agent needs brand assets:

1. Resolve domain to canonical brand via brand.json
2. Get brand manifest (from agent or inline)
3. Generate on-brand creatives

### Brand Verification

When verifying brand claims:

1. Fetch brand.json from claimed domain
2. Follow redirects to house if needed
3. Verify brand exists in portfolio

### Reporting Roll-up

When aggregating brand performance:

1. Resolve all brand domains to canonical IDs
2. Group by house for corporate-level reporting
3. Optionally include/exclude sub-brands

## Brand Context in Requests

The Brand Protocol is **additive**, not required. Agents should accept brand context in multiple ways:

| Request Field | Behavior |
|--------------|----------|
| `brand_manifest: {...}` | Use explicit inline manifest (highest priority) |
| `brand_domain: "nike.com"` | Resolve via Brand Protocol |
| `brand_url: "https://..."` | Fetch directly from URL |
| *(none provided)* | Operate without brand context |

This flexibility allows:
- Agencies to pass manifests they already have cached
- Automatic discovery when only domain is known
- Generic operation when no brand context is needed

## Caching

Brand information changes infrequently (logo updates, guideline refreshes). Recommended caching:

- **HTTP headers**: Use standard `ETag`, `Last-Modified`, and `Cache-Control` headers
- **Default TTL**: 24 hours for validated brand.json files
- **Failed lookups**: Cache for 1 hour before retrying
- **last_updated field**: Informational timestamp in brand.json for staleness checks

Agents should respect HTTP caching headers when fetching brand.json files.

## Future Considerations

### Digital Asset Management (DAM)

For brands requiring fine-grained control over asset usage, the `brand_agent` variant provides a natural integration point for DAM systems. Agents can:
- Enforce access control per asset
- Track usage and licensing
- Provide assets with usage terms
- Log access for compliance

This is optional—brands publishing static brand.json files grant implied permission for compliant creative use. DAM integration is for enterprises with complex licensing requirements.

## MCP Tools

The Brand Protocol provides MCP tools for programmatic access:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `resolve_brand` | Resolve domain to canonical brand identity |
| `validate_brand_json` | Validate a domain's brand.json |
| `validate_brand_agent` | Test brand agent reachability |
