# Signals Protocol

The Signals Protocol enables AI agents to discover, activate, and manage data signals for advertising campaigns. Signals represent targetable audiences, contextual categories, geographic regions, and other data attributes.

## What Are Signals?

Signals are data segments that can be used for targeting or measurement in advertising campaigns. They include:

- **Audience Signals**: User segments based on demographics, interests, or behaviors
- **Contextual Signals**: Content categories or page contexts
- **Geographic Signals**: Location-based targeting data
- **Temporal Signals**: Time-based targeting patterns
- **Multi-dimensional Signals**: Combined or custom signal types

## Key Capabilities

The Signals Protocol provides:

- Natural language signal discovery based on marketing objectives
- Multi-platform signal discovery in a single request
- Signal activation for specific platforms and accounts
- Transparent pricing with CPM and revenue share models
- Signal size reporting with unit types (individuals, devices, households)

## Tasks

| Task | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| [`get_signals`](/docs/signals/tasks/get_signals) | Discover signals matching campaign criteria |
| [`activate_signal`](/docs/signals/tasks/activate_signal) | Activate a signal for use in campaigns |

## Agent Integration

The Signals Protocol operates within the broader [AdCP Ecosystem](/docs/intro#the-adcp-ecosystem-layers), enabling signal agents to integrate directly with decisioning platforms (DSPs, orchestration platforms).

### Direct Integration Model

Signal agents contract directly with decisioning platforms, eliminating intermediary reporting and usage tracking. Once signals are activated on a decisioning platform, all usage reporting, billing, and campaign metrics are handled directly by that platform.

## Getting Started

1. **Discover signals** using `get_signals` with a natural language brief
2. **Review pricing** and signal sizes in the response
3. **Activate signals** using `activate_signal` for your target platform
4. **Use in campaigns** via the platform's standard targeting interface

See the [Protocol Specification](/docs/signals/specification) for complete technical details.
