## Quick Start

**Already know which protocol you're using?**

- [MCP Integration Guide](/docs/building/integration/mcp-guide) - For Claude, AI assistants, and MCP-compatible tools
- [A2A Integration Guide](/docs/building/integration/a2a-guide) - For Google AI agents and A2A-compatible workflows

**Need to choose a protocol?**

See [Protocol Comparison](/docs/building/understanding/protocol-comparison) for a detailed comparison.

## Section Overview

### Understanding AdCP

Conceptual foundation for everyone working with AdCP:

- **[Why AdCP](/docs/building/understanding)** - The strategic vision: unifying buying paradigms and enabling AI surfaces
- **[Protocol Comparison](/docs/building/understanding/protocol-comparison)** - MCP vs A2A at a glance

### Foundations

Technical building blocks for any AdCP implementation:

- **[MCP Guide](/docs/building/integration/mcp-guide)** - Tool calls, context, and examples
- **[A2A Guide](/docs/building/integration/a2a-guide)** - Tasks, streaming, and artifacts
- **[Capability Discovery](/docs/protocol/get_adcp_capabilities)** - Discover what an agent supports
- **[Authentication](/docs/building/integration/authentication)** - Credentials and permissions
- **[Context & Sessions](/docs/building/integration/context-sessions)** - Managing state across requests
- **[Schemas and SDKs](/docs/building/schemas-and-sdks)** - Access schemas and official client libraries

### Implementation Patterns

For building robust, production-ready systems:

- **[Task Lifecycle](/docs/building/implementation/task-lifecycle)** - Status values, transitions, and polling
- **[Async Operations](/docs/building/implementation/async-operations)** - Handling sync, async, and interactive tasks
- **[Webhooks](/docs/building/implementation/webhooks)** - Push notifications and reliability patterns
- **[Error Handling](/docs/building/implementation/error-handling)** - Error categories, codes, and recovery
- **[Security](/docs/building/implementation/security)** - Security considerations and best practices
- **[Orchestrator Design](/docs/building/implementation/orchestrator-design)** - State machines and system architecture
