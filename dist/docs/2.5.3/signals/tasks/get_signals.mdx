title: get_signals
---


**Task**: Discover signals based on description, with details about where they are deployed.

**Response Time**: ~60 seconds (inference/RAG with back-end systems)

**Request Schema**: [`https://adcontextprotocol.org/schemas/v2/signals/get-signals-request.json`](https://adcontextprotocol.org/schemas/v2/signals/get-signals-request.json)
**Response Schema**: [`https://adcontextprotocol.org/schemas/v2/signals/get-signals-response.json`](https://adcontextprotocol.org/schemas/v2/signals/get-signals-response.json)

The `get_signals` task returns both signal metadata and real-time deployment status across platforms, allowing agents to understand availability and guide the activation process.

## Request Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `signal_spec` | string | Yes | Natural language description of the desired signals |
| `deliver_to` | DeliverTo | Yes | Deployment targets where signals need to be activated (see Deliver To Object below) |
| `filters` | Filters | No | Filters to refine results (see Filters Object below) |
| `max_results` | number | No | Maximum number of results to return |

### Deliver To Object

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `deployments` | Destination[] | Yes | List of deployment targets (DSPs, sales agents, etc.) - see Destination Object below |
| `countries` | string[] | Yes | Countries where signals will be used (ISO codes) |

### Destination Object

Each deployment target uses a `type` field to discriminate between platform-based and agent-based deployments:

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `type` | string | Yes | Discriminator: "platform" for DSPs, "agent" for sales agents |
| `platform` | string | Conditional* | Platform identifier (e.g., 'the-trade-desk', 'amazon-dsp'). Required when type="platform" |
| `agent_url` | string (URI) | Conditional* | URL identifying the sales agent. Required when type="agent" |
| `account` | string | No | Account identifier on the platform or agent |

*`platform` is required when `type="platform"`, `agent_url` is required when `type="agent"`.

**Activation Keys**: If the authenticated caller has access to any of the deployment targets in the request, the signal agent will include `activation_key` fields in the response for those deployments (when `is_live: true`).

**Permission Model**: The signal agent determines key inclusion based on the caller's authentication and authorization. For example:
- A sales agent receives keys for deployments matching its `agent_url`
- A buyer with credentials for multiple DSP platforms receives keys for all those deployments
- Access is determined by the signal agent's permission system, not by flags in the request

### Filters Object

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `catalog_types` | string[] | No | Filter by catalog type ("marketplace", "custom", "owned") |
| `data_providers` | string[] | No | Filter by specific data providers |
| `max_cpm` | number | No | Maximum CPM price filter |
| `min_coverage_percentage` | number | No | Minimum coverage requirement |

## Response Structure

All AdCP responses include:
- **message**: Human-readable summary of the operation result
- **context_id**: Session continuity identifier for follow-up requests  
- **data**: Task-specific payload (see Response Data below)

The response structure is identical across protocols, with only the transport wrapper differing:
- **MCP**: Returns complete response as flat JSON
- **A2A**: Returns as artifacts with message in text part, data in data part

```

## Protocol-Specific Examples

The AdCP payload is identical across protocols. Only the request/response wrapper differs.

### MCP Request - Sales Agent Requesting Signals

A sales agent querying for signals. Because the authenticated caller is wonderstruck.salesagents.com, the signal agent will include activation keys in the response:

```json
{
  "tool": "get_signals",
  "arguments": {
    "signal_spec": "High-income households interested in luxury goods",
    "deliver_to": {
      "deployments": [

- **A2A**: Skill invocation with input, returns structured artifacts with message and data separated
- **Data Consistency**: Both protocols contain identical AdCP data structures and version information

## Scenarios

### All Platforms Discovery

Discover all available deployments across platforms:

```json
{
  
  "signal_spec": "Contextual segments for luxury automotive content",
  "deliver_to": {

## Error Codes

### Discovery Errors
- `SIGNAL_AGENT_SEGMENT_NOT_FOUND`: Signal agent segment ID doesn't exist
- `AGENT_NOT_FOUND`: Private signal agent not visible to this principal
- `AGENT_ACCESS_DENIED`: Principal not authorized for this signal agent

### Discovery Warnings
- `PRICING_UNAVAILABLE`: Pricing data temporarily unavailable for one or more platforms
- `PARTIAL_COVERAGE`: Some requested platforms don't support this signal type
- `STALE_DATA`: Some signal metadata may be outdated due to provider refresh delays

## Usage Notes

1. **Authentication-Based Keys**: Activation keys are only returned when the authenticated caller matches one of the deployment targets
2. **Permission Security**: The signal agent determines key inclusion based on caller identity, not request flags
3. **Deployment Status**: Check `is_live` to determine if activation is needed
4. **Multiple Deployments**: Query multiple deployment targets to check availability across platforms
5. **Activation Required**: If `is_live` is false, use the `activate_signal` task
6. **The message field** provides a quick summary of the most relevant findings

### Response - Multiple Signals Found

## Implementation Guide

### Generating Signal Messages

The `message` field should provide actionable insights:

```python
def generate_signals_message(signals, request):
    if not signals:
        return generate_no_signals_message(request.signal_spec)
    
    # Analyze deployment readiness
    ready_count = sum(1 for s in signals if all_platforms_live(s, request.deliver_to))
    best_signal = find_best_signal(signals)
