## What is AdCP?

Ad Context Protocol (AdCP) is an **open standard for advertising automation** that enables AI assistants to interact with advertising platforms through natural language. Built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), AdCP provides:

- üîå **Unified Advertising API** - Single interface for all advertising platforms
- ü§ñ **AI-Powered Automation** - Built for natural language campaign management
- üìä **Cross-Platform Analytics** - Standardized reporting across all platforms  
- üîì **Open Standard** - No vendor lock-in, community-driven development
- ‚ö° **Programmatic Ready** - Designed for modern ad tech workflows

### Quick Example

Instead of navigating complex interfaces:

> "Find audience signals of premium sports enthusiasts who would be interested in high-end running shoes, and activate them on Scope3."

The AI assistant handles:
- Signal discovery across platforms
- Transparent pricing comparison  
- Direct activation on decisioning platforms

## Available Protocols

### üéØ Signals Activation Protocol - RFC/v0.1
Discover and activate data signals using natural language.

- **Natural Language Discovery**: "High-income millennials interested in sustainable fashion" (audience signal)
- **Contextual Signals**: "Premium automotive content with high viewability"
- **Multi-Dimensional**: Combine geographical, temporal, and behavioral signals
- **Multi-Platform Activation**: Deploy across DSPs and data platforms
- **Transparent Pricing**: CPM and revenue share models
- **Real-time Status**: Track activation and deployment progress

### üìç Curation Protocol - Coming Q2 2025
Curate media inventory based on context and brand safety requirements.

### üí∞ Media Buy Protocol - RFC/v0.1  
Execute and optimize media buys programmatically across platforms.

## Quick Start

### For Platform Providers

Implement AdCP to enable AI-powered workflows for your customers:

1. **Review the Specification**: [Signals Protocol](https://adcontextprotocol.github.io/docs/signals/specification)
2. **Implement MCP Server**: Check out the [reference implementations](#reference-implementations)
3. **Test Your Implementation**: Use the validation test suite

### For Advertisers & Agencies

Use AdCP-enabled platforms with your AI assistant:

1. **Check Platform Support**: See which platforms support AdCP
2. **Configure Your AI**: Connect AdCP-enabled platforms to Claude, GPT, or other assistants
3. **Start Using**: Describe your marketing objectives in natural language
