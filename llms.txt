# Ad Context Protocol (AdCP)

## Project Overview
Ad Context Protocol (AdCP) is an open standard that enables AI assistants to interact with advertising platforms through natural language. Built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), AdCP allows marketers to discover audiences, curate inventory, and execute campaigns using conversational AI.
