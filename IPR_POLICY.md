# AdCP INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS (IPR) POLICY

## 1. Purpose
This Policy governs the ownership, licensing, and use of intellectual property contributed to or arising from the activities of the Ad Context Protocol Foundation (the “Foundation”). The Foundation exists to develop, maintain, and promote the Ad Context Protocol (AdCP) as an open, interoperable, and widely adopted advertising standard.  The Policy ensures that AdCP remains:
- Enabling all participants in the advertising ecosystem to implement it without barriers.
- Avoiding proprietary lock-in.
- Ensuring flexibility for AI-powered automation and evolving workflows.
- Protecting the Foundation’s name, specifications, and community processes.

## 2. Copyright
- *2.1 License Grant.* Each Member grants the Foundation and all implementers of AdCP a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, modify, prepare derivative works of, distribute, publicly perform, and publicly display any Contribution submitted to the Foundation.
- *2.2 Conditions.* A Member may only submit Contributions that it owns or has sufficient rights to license.
- *2.3 Collective Works.* Draft specifications, final specifications, and other collaborative outputs authored by the Foundation (collectively, “Collective Works”) shall be owned by the Foundation. Members retain ownership of their underlying Contributions but license them to the Foundation as set forth in 2.1.
- *2.4 Source Code.* Contributions of source code and accompanying documentation shall be licensed under the Apache 2.0 License as documented in [LICENSE](https://github.com/adcontextprotocol/adcp/blob/main/LICENSE), unless a Working Group explicitly approves an alternative open-source license.
- *2.5 Documentation.* All public documentation (e.g. protocol definitions, developer guides) shall be released under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (CC-BY-4.0).

## 3. Patents
- *3.1 Royalty-Free Commitment.* By default, all Foundation work shall be developed under a Royalty-Free (RF) licensing commitment. Each Member grants a perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, non-exclusive, worldwide license under its Necessary Claims to make, use, sell, import, and distribute compliant implementations of any Final Specification.
- *3.2 RAND Option.* The Board may approve a Reasonable and Non-Discriminatory (RAND) mode for specific technical areas if (i) RF licensing is not feasible, and (ii) a supermajority of the relevant Working Group supports RAND.
- *3.3 Disclosure.* Members are obligated to disclose patents or published applications containing Necessary Claims of which they have actual knowledge during the development of a Draft Specification.
- *3.4 Exclusion Right.* A Member may exclude specific patent claims by providing written notice within thirty (30) days of Draft Specification publication. Claims not excluded remain subject to the RF license.
- *3.5 Survival.* Patent commitments made under this Policy survive withdrawal or termination of membership and remain binding with respect to any Final Specification adopted during the Member’s participation.

## 4. Trademarks
- *4.1* The Foundation shall own all rights in the “AdCP” name, logos, certification marks, and related brand identifiers.
- *4.2* Members may identify themselves as Foundation members.
- *4.3* Use of “AdCP-Compliant” or similar designations requires successful completion of the Foundation’s certification or conformance program.

## 5. Confidentiality
- *5.1* Draft specifications and non-final work products are deemed confidential until publicly released.
- *5.2* Patent disclosures, exclusion notices, and related materials submitted by Members shall be treated as confidential and used solely for standards evaluation.
- *5.3* Confidentiality does not extend to information that is publicly known, already in the Member’s possession, obtained lawfully from a third party, or independently developed.

## 6. Warranties & Disclaimers
