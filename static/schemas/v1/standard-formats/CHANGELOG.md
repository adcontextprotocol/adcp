## [2.0.0] - 2025-09-03

### Breaking Changes ðŸš¨

**Major Philosophy Shift: Properties in Names, Not Flags**
- Format names now include critical properties (e.g., `video_skippable_15s` instead of `video_15s` with capability flag)
- Removed capability flags in favor of descriptive naming
- Third-party serving now handled via asset types, not duplicate formats

### Added

**New Asset Types for Dynamic Creative (DCO)**:
- `dynamic_endpoint` - Webhook-based dynamic creative delivery
- `javascript` - Client-side JavaScript rendering
- `template` - Template-based creative with data binding

**New Descriptive Format Names**:
- Video: `video_skippable_15s`, `video_non_skippable_30s` (replaces generic `video_15s`)
- Display: `display_expandable_300x250`, `display_interstitial_320x480` (properties in names)
- Dynamic: `display_dynamic_300x250` (DCO format using endpoint asset)

### Changed

**Renamed Categories**:
- `foundational` â†’ `universal` (clearer multi-publisher meaning)
- Removed `retail` category (formats work across verticals)

**Format Naming Convention**:
- All formats now use descriptive names with key properties
- Removed `3p` variants (third-party serving via asset types)
- Consistent pattern: `{type}_{property}_{size/duration}`

### Removed

- Capability flags (replaced by descriptive names)
- Duplicate third-party formats (e.g., `display_3p_300x250`)
- `retail` category (universal_carousel works for all verticals)

### Technical Improvements

- DCO modeled correctly as asset delivery method
- Cleaner taxonomy with ~35 core formats
- Format properties visible in names for better discoverability
