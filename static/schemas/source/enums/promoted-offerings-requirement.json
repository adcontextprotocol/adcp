  "description": "Content requirements that a creative format can impose on promoted offerings. Each value asserts that the referenced content must be present and non-empty. Top-level values (si_agent_url, offerings) are checked directly on the PromotedOfferings object — 'offerings' requires the catalog to contain resolved items (regardless of sourcing: inline items, external URL, or platform-synced). offerings.* paths check that every resolved catalog item has the specified field present and non-empty — a payload that mixes items with and without the field does not satisfy the requirement. Including an offerings.* value implicitly requires offerings to be present and non-empty. For brand.* paths, the brand reference must be resolved (looked up from brand.json or registry) before checking the nested field. If the reference cannot be resolved, all brand.* requirements are considered unmet. Paths are limited to two segments.",
