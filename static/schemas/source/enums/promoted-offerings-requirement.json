  "description": "Content requirements that a creative format can impose on promoted offerings. Each value asserts that the referenced content must be present and non-empty. Top-level values (si_agent_url, offerings) are checked directly on the PromotedOfferings object. For brand_manifest.* paths, the brand_manifest reference must be resolved (URL dereferenced if needed) before checking the nested field. If the reference cannot be resolved, all brand_manifest.* requirements are considered unmet. Paths are limited to two segments.",
